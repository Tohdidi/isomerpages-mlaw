{:start="1"}
1. Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a second time".

{:start="2"}
2. This Bill comes before Parliament in the midst of very serious challenges faced by us, which Ministers and MPs have spoken about a number of times.

{:start="3"}
3. In my speech, I will: 

a. Explain why we need this intervention;

b. Explain the principles behind the Bill; and 

c. Set out the key features of the Bill.

**(I) Introduction**

{:start="4"}
4. Just under two months ago, I moved an urgent Bill in this House – the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, which I will refer to as "COVID 1".

{:start="5"}
5. COVID 1 was in itself a major intervention.

{:start="6"}
6. In my speech then, I explained why intervention was needed. The economic shock was unprecedented in magnitude (in terms of the impact), and the speed at which this impact was felt. 

{:start="7"}
7. I also set out the principles for such intervention. The starting point is always that the sanctity of contract is fundamental. It’s a key aspect of the rule of law, and we do not lightly intervene. 

{:start="8"}
8. But sanctity of contract cannot be an absolute. 

{:start="9"}
9. I said that intervention is needed when the core interests of our people are at stake, and there is a need to safeguard the fundamental integrity of the economic structure for common good. 

{:start="10"}
10. Such intervention has to be reasonable and of generally limited duration. 

{:start="11"}
11. In COVID 1, we put in what I called a “legal circuit breaker”. It provided a framework to hold in abeyance the strict enforcement of certain legal rights for a period of time. The objective was to give businesses some cash flow relief, and breathing space to make adjustments.

{:start="12"}
12. For example, if a business tenant is unable to pay rent during the relief period because of COVID-19, the landlord cannot evict the tenant during the relief period. The moratorium runs until 19 October 2020. 

{:start="13"}
13. At the time, I emphasised that COVID 1 only deferred contractual obligations. I also explained to this House that the Bill gave businesses breathing space. 

{:start="14"}
14. It also gave the Government some time to take in feedback, assess the evolving situation, conduct a deeper analysis, and decide whether more substantive interventions were needed. 

**(II) Why we are now going further**

{:start="15"}
15. For the past two months, we have done precisely that. We monitored feedback, assessed the situation and thought carefully about what else needed to be done. 

{:start="16"}
16. And we have decided to intervene in a more substantive way to deal with the issue of rent, and also intervene in some other areas. I will explain why. 

{:start="17"}
17. Two months ago, the circuit breaker began. For many – including the businesses most affected by those measures – April now feels like a lifetime away. 

{:start="18"}
18. Globally, we were looking then at 1.2 million infections and 67,000 people dead. 

{:start="19"}
19. As of 1 June, we are looking at more than 6 million infections and more than 370,000 people dead. 

{:start="20"}
20. Various restrictions had already been put in place by then, but the circuit breaker caused a substantial increase in the restrictions. 

{:start="21"}
21. What is the situation today? DPM and other Ministers have explained in considerable detail. 

{:start="22"}
22. I will just recap two key points. 

a. The economic situation and outlook have deteriorated substantially. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is now forecasting a contraction of the economy between 4% to 7%. 

b. There is a lot of uncertainty. We are taking a cautious approach in the lifting of the circuit breaker measures.  

{:start="23"}
23. Many industries are affected. And for some, the impact has been near catastrophic. 

{:start="24"}
24. The latest data from the Department of Statistics, some just released today:

a. F&B sales declined by 23.7% in March 2020. In April 2020, it declined by 53%, on a year-on-year basis.

b. Retail sale (if you exclude supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stalls) declined by 13.3% in March 2020, and in April 2020, by nearly 61%.

{:start="25"}
25. These numbers do not even show the full impact of the circuit breaker, because the data for May 2020 is not out yet. We can obviously expect the numbers to be very weak. 

{:start="26"}
26. Revenue has fallen but meanwhile fixed costs continue. For many businesses in the F&B and retail sector, two significant components of costs are manpower and rent. 

{:start="27"}
27. As regards manpower, the Government, through the various Budgets, provided the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), waived the Foreign Worker Levy and put in a number of other schemes to help, together with partners like NTUC. 

{:start="28"}
28. This Bill seeks to deal with the rental obligations, amongst other things.

{:start="29"}
29. Many landlords have taken a helpful approach and a long-term view. They have shared the burden with their tenants.

{:start="30"}
30. Nevertheless, we received a lot of feedback from struggling SMEs, that they need more time to recover. Many can’t open until Phase 2, and even then only partially.

{:start="31"}
31. Landlords' concessions have been uneven. Many landlords have rendered substantive assistance, but several others have not. 

{:start="32"}
32. The point is that accumulated arrears should be handled fairly. 

{:start="33"}
33. One piece of feedback we received was from a tenant who is a mother of two young children. She started a company two years ago, providing enrichment lessons to children. She leased some space for the business as a sub-tenant. She renewed her lease for one year, just before COVID-19 hit. All revenue that came in went back to support the business, including payment of rent, salaries for trainers and other operational costs. 

{:start="34"}
34. But from February 2020, parents began to keep students away. Classes have been suspended since March 2020. 

{:start="35"}
35. Her landlord has only offered her a 10% discount in rent for April and May 2020. 

{:start="36"}
36. COVID-19 is quite an unforeseeable event, both in magnitude and speed of impact, wiping out the hard work that many people had put into their business. So if some landlords insist on payments that tenants cannot afford, tenants will give up. Landlords will then have to take chances, recover something in the insolvency proceedings, together with other creditors. 

{:start="37"}
37. Landlords will then also have to find replacement tenants. In this market, it is not realistic.

{:start="38"}
38. Therefore, it is really in everyone’s interests to take a sensible approach, to ensure everyone comes out of this together, ready to recover.

{:start="39"}
39. If you look at a survey by restaurant booking platform Chope: 81% of the respondents said that they would not be able to operate beyond the next six months, based on the cost and revenue that they had during the circuit breaker period. 

{:start="40}
40. After watching all of this carefully, taking in feedback, looking at the numbers that were coming in, we decided that there was a need for more substantive intervention. 

{:start="41"}
41. The challenge that rent poses to small businesses is not a problem unique to Singapore. A number of other countries have seen that, and they have intervened.

{:start="42"}
42. I will give the examples of Australia and Germany.  

{:start="43"}
43. In Australia, landlords are required to offer rent waivers and deferrals to SME tenants. And SME tenants are allowed to repay the deferred rent over a period of at least 24 months, interest-free. 

{:start="44"}
44. In Germany, landlords are not allowed to terminate a tenancy for non-payment of rent. Arrears with accumulated interest can be repaid before 30 June 2022. That means two years of extension.
