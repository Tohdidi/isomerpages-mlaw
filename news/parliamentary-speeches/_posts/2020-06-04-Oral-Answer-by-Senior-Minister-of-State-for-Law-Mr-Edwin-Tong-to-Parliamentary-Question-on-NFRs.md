Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) 

<b><u>Question</u></b>

To ask the Minister for Law what is the number of Notifications for Relief applied for since the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act came into effect and what are the numbers for each category.

<b><u>Oral Answer</u></b>

1.	The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (“Act”) commenced on 20 April 2020. As at 29 May 2020, which is around five weeks since the Act commenced, 3,943 Notifications for Relief (“NFRs”) have been served using the online system. Parties may also serve the NFRs in hardcopy on the contracting parties. We are unable to track the number of hardcopy NFRs which parties may have served.

2.	The vast majority of the NFRs served relate to two types of contracts. First, hire-purchase agreements or conditional sales agreements for commercial plant or machinery, or commercial vehicles; and second, leases or licences of non-residential property. 

3.	The number of NFRs served as of 29 May 2020 for each category of contract is as follows: <br>
    a.	Hire-purchase and conditional sales agreements: 2,107<br>
    b.	Leases or licences of non-residential property: 1,254<br>
    c.	Event and tourism-related contracts: 250<br>
    d.	Construction contracts and supply contracts: 213<br>
    e.	Certain secured loans to SMEs: 97<br>
    f.	Option to purchase given by housing developer, or sales and purchase agreements between purchasers and housing developers for housing accommodation – which were only added to the list of scheduled contracts on 13 May 2020: 22

4.	We would like to encourage contracting parties to be fair and reasonable to each other, considering that the impact of COVID-19 was an event that no one could expect. In doing so, parties should be better able to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
