At around 4.50pm on 14 May 2020, Mr Thum Ping Tjin put up a Correction Notice on his Facebook page, and stated that this was in response to a "belated request" that he had received from the Government*. In response to media queries arising from Mr Thum's comment, the Ministry of Law issued the following statement:

"There was no belated request. POFMA Office issued Mr Thum a Direction to put up a correction on his Facebook page on 13 May at around 3 pm within 24 hours. He did not comply and was in breach of the POFMA Direction. 

The POFMA Office then issued a warning at 4.06 pm on 14 May, to give Mr Thum a further opportunity to comply.

This warning was sent to the <b>same email address</b> of Mr Thum's as the correction direction of 13 May, <b>and as part of the same email chain</b>.

The first line of the warning referred to the correction direction of 13 May.

Mr Thum then complied.

Mr Thum could not have overlooked the first notice either. The warning was sent, on the same email chain that contained the previous dayâ€™s Direction. Thus Mr Thum cannot possibly have genuinely thought that the request was belated."

(See [Chronology of POFMA Office's Exchanges with Mr Thum](/files/news/replies/Chronology_of_POFMA_Office_exchanges _with_Mr_Thum.pdf))

*At 8.22 pm on 14 May 2020, POFMA Office sent Mr Thum a further email, objecting to his allegation that the Government had made a "belated request" for correction, and stating that it was untrue in view of the correspondence between themselves and Mr Thum. Mr Thum has since removed this allegation from his Facebook post.
