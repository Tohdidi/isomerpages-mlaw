1. We refer to the recent Voice of America ("VOA") article, <i>Singapore's Fake News and Contempt Laws a Threat to Media, Journalists Say</i>, on the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ("POFMA") and the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act ("AJPA"). 

2. The article contains serious errors and misrepresentations over matters which are widely available in the public domain. Links to some of these public materials are set out in <u>Annex A</u>. We encourage all interested persons to study them carefully and form their own views.

3. POFMA is in fact narrower than existing legislation on dealing with falsehoods.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The Government has long had broad powers to order takedowns and limit publication of material. POFMA provides a set of narrower powers than existing legislation already does.

4. The article claims that the laws are being used to "silence and harass independent news outlets", that these laws are open to abuse by the Government and that "a government minister can be an arbiter of truth".

5. On the contrary, POFMA expressly provides for the High Court to decide the truth or falsity of a statement of fact. It is the Court, not the Government, that finally decides whether an assertion was false, and hence whether the POFMA direction was properly issued.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> POFMA also prescribes an expedited process for the Court to do so, at little or no cost to the publisher.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> This is in fact how all POFMA appeals have been handled. 

6. Furthermore, the Government has undertaken to use corrections as the primary tool, rather than takedowns.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Where corrections are posted alongside, the original articles remain completely accessible. They are neither censored nor amended, enabling readers to see <u>both</u> the primary piece and the correction, and to make up their own minds.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> The corrections therefore add to, and take nothing away from, public discourse, contrary to the article.
