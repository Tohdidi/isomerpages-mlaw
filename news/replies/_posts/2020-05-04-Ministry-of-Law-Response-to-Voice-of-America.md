1. We refer to the recent Voice of America ("VOA") article, <i>Singapore's Fake News and Contempt Laws a Threat to Media, Journalists Say</i>, on the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ("POFMA") and the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act ("AJPA"). 

2. The article contains serious errors and misrepresentations over matters which are widely available in the public domain. Links to some of these public materials are set out in <u>Annex A</u>. We encourage all interested persons to study them carefully and form their own views.

3. POFMA is in fact narrower than existing legislation on dealing with falsehoods.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The Government has long had broad powers to order takedowns and limit publication of material. POFMA provides a set of narrower powers than existing legislation already does.
