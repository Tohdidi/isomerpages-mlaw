In response to queries on comments made by Mr Thum Ping Tjin on a "belated request" he had received to put up a Correction Notice on his Facebook post, the Ministry of Law issued the following statement:

"There was no belated request. POFMA Office issued Mr Thum a Direction to put up a correction on his Facebook page on 13 May at around 3 pm within 24 hours. He did not comply and was in breach of the POFMA Direction. 

The POFMA Office then issued a warning at 4.06 pm on 14 May, to give Mr Thum a further opportunity to comply.

This warning was sent to the <b>same email address</b> of Mr Thum's as the correction direction of 13 May, <b>and as part of the same email chain</b>.

The first line of the warning referred to the correction direction of 13 May.

Mr Thum then complied.

Mr Thum could not have overlooked the first notice either. The warning was sent, on the same email chain that contained the previous dayâ€™s Direction. Thus Mr Thum cannot possibly have genuinely thought that the request was belated."
