We refer to recent letters from ZB readers about the Rental Relief Framework, to help SMEs affected by COVID-19.

The Law passed in Parliament provides rent waivers and other relief to SMEs.  The rental waivers are for the period of April to July 2020 for eligible SMEs in commercial properties (the Government will provide 2 months of cash rebates, and landlords will waive 2 months), and April to May 2020 for eligible SMEs in industrial/office properties (the Government will provide one month cash rebate, and Landlords will waive one month rent). The leases or licences must be entered into before 25 March 2020, or entered into before 25 March 2020 and subsequently renewed. Landlords are required to provide immediate rental relief to their SME tenants.

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will issue the notice of cash grant or nominal notice to qualifying property owners from end-July 2020. IRAS will provide more details of the cash grant on its website, once they are finalised.

Landlords who face genuine financial hardship and are unable to afford to give the mandated rental waiver may seek an assessment by an Assessor, appointed by the Ministry of Law, who can halve the amount of additional rental relief to be provided by the landlord. They will take into consideration the annual value of the landlord’s properties and the proportion of the landlord’s dependence on the rental income for his livelihood. More information on the application process and assessment criteria will be shared in due course.

We would also like to highlight that while the Government cash grant to be provided to landlords is based on the net rent of the property, the value of the rental waiver to be provided by landlords is based on the base rent of the tenant. Base rent, for the most part, should be lower than net rent as it excludes any variable rent based on gross turnover as well as maintenance fee and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security.

In times like this, when many parties are facing challenges, it is in everyone’s interest to communicate with an open mind and come to a mutual arrangement to tide through this crisis together.

谨答复近日针对为帮助受到冠病疫情影响的中小企业，而制定的租金减免框架，投函《联合早报·交流站》的多名读者：

国会通过的法律，为中小企业提供租金减免和其他补助。符合条件的商业房地产中小企业租户，可豁免4月至7月的租金（政府将提供两个月的现金补助，业主则承担两个月的租金）；而符合条件的工业和办公房地产中小企业租户，可豁免4月和5月的租金（政府将提供一个月的现金补助，业主则承担一个月的租金）。租户的租约或执照，必须在今年3月25日前生效或更新。业主须即时向中小企业租户提供租金援助。

新加坡国内税务局将从今年7月底起，向符合条件的业主，发出现金补助通知。现金补助的细节一旦敲定，税务局将在其网站公布更多详情。

业主如确实面临财务困难，无法承担当局所规定的租金减免，可申请由律政部委派的评定员（Assessor）进行评估；评定员可将业主所须承担的额外租金减免减半。当局会根据收租是否占业主每月收入的可观部分，及业主产业的年值作出评估。有关申请程序及评估准则的更多详情，将于稍后公布。

我们还希望强调的是，政府提供给业主的现金补助，是根据物业的净租金计算；而业主提供的租金减免额，是根据租户的基本租金计算。在大多数情况下，基本租金应低于净租金，因为它不包括根据总营业额计算的任何可变动租金，以及维修费和提供清洁及保安等服务的费用。

面对当前的艰难局势，各方都面临许多挑战，以开放的心态沟通，达成共同的协议，共渡难关，符合各方利益。
