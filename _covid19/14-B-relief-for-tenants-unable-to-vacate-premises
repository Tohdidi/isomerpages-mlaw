### Relief for tenants unable to vacate business premises ###

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill (the “**Amendment Bill**”) was passed in Parliament on 5 June 2020.

The Amendment Bill introduces measures that will assist tenants who, because of COVID-19, are unable to vacate their business premises after the lease or licence comes to an end. A tenant could be liable to pay double rent or other charges for the period after the expiry of the lease or licence, even though the failure to vacate the premises is through no fault of their own.

The Amendment Bill provides that, in such situations, the tenant will not be liable to its landlord for failing to vacate the property, except as otherwise prescribed by the Minister.

In order to qualify for the relief, the tenant will have to serve a notification for relief on the landlord and meet such other conditions as may be prescribed by the Minister.

The Ministry of Law is working to bring these measures into force. Further details will be announced at a later date.
