**a.	Why has the Government decided to implement this rental relief framework?**

*	The rental relief framework seeks to help affected SMEs, and specified non-profit organisations (“NPOs”) with their cash flow by providing for the fair handling of their accumulated rental obligations, and a fair sharing of economic hardship due to the impact of COVID-19 among the Government, landlords and tenants. 

*	The Government does not ordinarily intervene in private contracts. However, due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on SMEs, the Government has decided to take targeted and temporary measures to intervene to safeguard the economic structure for the common good. The rental relief measures are necessary to support SMEs and the broader economy, which will in turn help property owners continue to enjoy the stable value of their assets in the longer term. 

*	The framework also applies to specified NPOs that are similarly affected by the economic impact of COVID-19. These are NPOs operating with a clear public benefit to the community, businesses, and society at large. 


**b.	How many months of rental relief can an eligible SME or NPO tenant (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) obtain?**

*	Eligible SMEs and NPOs which are tenant-occupiers who operate their business in a rented property (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) can receive up to 4 months’ waiver of rent* for qualifying commercial properties (e.g. shops), and up to 2 months’ waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties), comprising the following:

    a)	<u>Rental Relief for eligible SME and NPO tenants (supported by Government assistance)</u>: Eligible tenant-occupiers in qualifying commercial properties and other non-residential properties will receive the rental relief through a waiver of rent from their landlords. Property owners will receive support through the: (a) Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 announced in the Unity and Resilience Budgets; and (b) Government cash grant announced in the Fortitude Budget. 
    
    Eligible SMEs and NPOs in qualifying commercial properties will receive up to 2 months’ waiver of their rent, and eligible SMEs and NPOs in other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties) will receive up to 1 months’ waiver of their rent. 
    
    b)	<u>Additional Rental Relief for SME and NPO tenants (supported by landlords/ property owners)</u>: Eligible SME and NPO tenant-occupiers who have seen a 35% or more drop in their average monthly gross income due to COVID-19 will receive up to an additional 2 months’ waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties, and up to an additional 1 month’s waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties). 

    For more details on the definitions of property in each category, please refer to [https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Property/Government-cash-grant--announced-in-Fortitude-Budget-/](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Property/Government-cash-grant--announced-in-Fortitude-Budget-/).
    
    *The value of the rent to be waived is based on the contractual rent of the tenant, excluding any maintenance fee and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security.

**c.	What period does the rental relief cover?**

*	Generally, the Rental Relief covers the first 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and the first month within the period of April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties).

*	For eligible tenant-occupiers which meet the criteria for the Additional Rental Relief, the Additional Rental Relief covers a further 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and a further 1 month within the period of  April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties.

*	In cases where rent has already been paid for the relevant relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.

Note: The rental waivers in the table are applicable in cases where the tenant-occupier occupies the property throughout the relief period. Please refer to the section “Specific Scenarios” for details of the application of the rental waivers in cases where the tenant-occupier does not occupy the property throughout the relief period.

**d.	What are the eligibility criteria for an SME/NPO tenant to qualify for the rental relief?**

*	The rental relief framework, comprising the Rental Relief and the Additional Rental Relief, applies to eligible tenant-occupiers of prescribed properties in qualifying leases or licences that are in writing, or evidenced in writing, which are:
 
    a)	(i) Entered into before 25 March 2020; or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and renewed either automatically or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract; and 
    
    b)	In force at any time between 1 April and 31 July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and between 1 April and 31 May 2020 for other non-residential (e.g. industrial/office) properties.
    
<u>Rental Relief</u>

*	Tenant-occupiers must fall within one of the following categories to be eligible for Rental Relief:

    a)	Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with not more than S$100 million in annual revenue for the Financial Year 2018 or a later appropriate period where applicable1, at the individual or entity level2; or
    
    
    b)	The following types of Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) with not more than S$100 million in annual revenue for the Financial Year 2018 or a later appropriate period where applicable<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, at the entity level:
    
       i. Registered or exempt charities (as provided in the Charities Act);
      ii. Members of the National Council of Social Service;
     iii. National sports associations;
      iv. National disability sports associations;
       v. Specified arts and culture societies; or
      vi. Specified trade associations.

<p><sup id="fn1">1. If the tenant-occupier has not carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of its financial year ending on a date in the year 2018, but has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of its financial year ending on a date in the year 2019, the reference period will be FY2019 instead. If the foregoing does not apply, but the tenant-occupier has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of its financial year ending on a date in the year 2020, where the date is on or before March 2020, the reference period will be FY 2020. For any other case, the tenant-occupier’s average monthly revenue from the time the tenant-occupier commenced business until 31 March 2020 (both dates inclusive) will be extrapolated for comparison against the $100 million annual revenue threshold. Please refer to Regulation 4 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020 for details. <a href="#fn1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>

**e.	Why is it necessary to compare revenue against the same period year on year? What if a tenant was not operational during the April to May 2019 period – how will the drop in revenue be assessed?** 

*	The reason why the same period of time for a year on year comparison is used is to account for seasonal fluctuations in revenue. 


*	Where tenants were not operational during the April to May 2019 period, the revenue could be compared to other periods that will reflect whether the tenant’s performance has been impacted by COVID-19, taking into account the nature of the business. More information on the treatment of such cases will be provided in due course.


**f.	Can the rental waivers be offset by any waivers or other forms of assistance that a landlord had passed on to his tenant prior to the implementation of the Act? What can be considered for the offset, if allowed?**

*	The rental waivers may be offset by:

    a)	Any monetary payments or reduction of rent or licence fee provided for, or previously agreed to, by the landlord to the tenant-occupier from February 2020 onwards; and/or


    b)	Any passing on of the Property Tax Rebate from property owners to their tenants.


*	More information on the types of assistance from landlords that can be offset will be provided in due course.  


**g.	When will the rental relief provisions in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures)(Amendment) Act come into force?**

*	The new rental relief provisions under Part 2A of the Act will come into force by end-July 2020. Agencies are currently working out the details and processes for the implementation of the relief.


**h.	What will happen after the Act comes into force?**

*	From end-July 2020, IRAS will issue a notice of cash grant and disburse the Government cash grant to qualifying property owners. Majority of the owners should receive the notice by mid-August 2020. Property owners are required to serve a copy of the notice to their tenants, or their master tenants. Master tenants who receive a copy of the notice are required to serve a copy of the notice to their sub-tenants.


*	Once the notice of cash grant is received, the rental is treated as waived under the Act. Landlords are obliged to notify their tenants. Eligible tenants do not need to do anything to qualify for the rental waivers and will enjoy the rental waivers automatically.  


*	More details of the cash grant can be found on [IRAS’ website](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Property/Government-cash-grant--announced-in-Fortitude-Budget-/).


**i.	What should landlords and tenants do in the meantime, before receiving the notice of cash grant from IRAS?**

*	Landlords and tenants are encouraged to work towards a mutual arrangement to implement the rental waivers provided for in the Act - a rental waiver for the period of April to July 2020 for eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties, and April to May 2020 for eligible SMEs in other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial/office properties).


*	In order for the waivers to work smoothly, tenants and landlords should communicate and share information. Where necessary, tenants may be required to share relevant information with their landlords to prove their eligibility for the Additional Rental Relief. This may include signed/declared management accounts for the relevant months, or if these are not available, a statutory declaration from the tenant.


*	Eligible tenants do not need to pay rent for the period covered by the rental relief framework. If rent has already been paid, tenants can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, get a refund from their landlords. 


*	However, tenants who do not qualify for relief and who do not pay rent will be subject to the consequences spelt out in the contract, including paying the rent accrued, and any applicable interest and charges.


**j.	Can a landlord take steps against an SME tenant for non-payment of rent for the months of April to June in the meantime?**

*	A landlord ought not to take such steps against eligible SME tenants, since the Act mandates rental waivers for the period of April to July 2020 for eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties, and April to May 2020 for eligible SMEs in other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial/office properties).


*	When the rental relief provisions under Part 2A of the Act comes into force, it will provide for a moratorium on action that can be taken against the tenant-occupier for non-payment of rent. 


*	At any time, tenants who are unable to pay their rent due to COVID-19 and who require protection from legal or enforcement proceedings by their landlords, may serve a Notification for Relief under the existing COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act using the form accessible at this [link](https://www.go.gov.sg/nfr). Once the Notification for Relief is served, the landlord may not terminate the lease nor take any of the prohibited actions stated in section 5(3) of the Act on the basis of non-payment of rent up to 19 October 2020.


**k.	How will landlords and tenants know if a tenant is eligible for rental relief? What documents should a tenant provide to prove his eligibility?**

*	Given the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, it should be clear in the majority of cases whether tenants qualify for relief. For example, it should be clear whether a tenant is an SME, and whether the tenant’s business suffered from the circuit breaker measures in April and May 2020.  


*	In the minority of cases where the landlord has some doubt, we encourage both parties to work together and share the necessary information. It is in the interests of both parties to communicate effectively, so that the position is clear and the waivers can work smoothly. 


*	Where necessary, tenants may be required to share relevant information with their landlords to prove their eligibility. Acceptable documentation include signed/declared management accounts for the relevant months, or if these are not available, a statutory declaration from the tenant. 


*	When the rental relief provisions under Part 2A of the Act comes into force, the Act will require tenants to provide the information required by the landlord. Further details on the information/ documents that landlords may request from their tenants will be provided in due course. 


**l.	What if my landlord does not provide me with the rental waiver? Are there any penalties for non-compliance by landlords?**

*	Under the Act, the rent that is payable by eligible tenants to their landlord for the relevant period of rental waiver is statutorily waived once eligible property owners receive the notice of the cash grant or nominal notice issued by IRAS. 


*	Eligible tenants are, by law, not liable to their landlord in respect of rent for those months and do not need to take further action to qualify for the rental waiver. 


#### Landlord’s application for assessment ####


**m.	What can a landlord do if he is not satisfied that his tenant is eligible for rental relief?**

*	The legislation will require that tenants provide prescribed documents proving their eligibility to the landlord upon request. 


*	Nonetheless, landlords will have the opportunity to apply to have an Assessor determine whether the tenant satisfies the eligibility criteria to receive the rental waiver. 


*	The Assessor’s determination will be binding on both the landlord and the tenant.


**n.	What can a landlord do if he is unable to afford a rental waiver?**

*	The Government recognises that there are landlords who may face genuine financial hardship.


*	Landlords who are unable to afford to give the mandated rental waiver may seek an assessment by the Assessor on the grounds of financial hardship. 


*	The Assessor will take into consideration the Annual Value of the landlord’s properties and the proportion of the landlord’s dependence on the rental income for his livelihood. 


*	If the landlord meets the grounds of financial hardship, the Assessor can halve the amount of additional rental relief. The Assessor’s determination will be binding on both the landlord and the tenant.


**o.	What is the process and criteria for assessment?**

*	More information on the application process and assessment criteria will be shared in due course. 


**p.	Will tenants have access to the assessment mechanism, either to challenge a landlord’s assertion of financial hardship, or to ascertain whether they are eligible?**

*	The assessment mechanism will use objective criteria to determine tenants’ eligibility and landlords that are facing financial hardship. 


*	If tenants are of the view that they are eligible but have not received a copy of the notice of cash grant from IRAS, they may seek clarification from IRAS. More details will be provided on IRAS’ website in due course. 


**q.	If a landlord’s share of the waiver is halved, who will bear the other half? Will the Government absorb this?**

*	If the additional rental relief that has to be paid by the landlord is halved, the tenant will have to pay his share of the rent accordingly. Both landlords and tenants alike have to play their part to pull through this difficult period.


#### Repayment scheme for rental arrears ####


**r.	What can a tenant do if he needs more time to repay his accumulated rental arrears?**

*	Eligible SMEs that qualify for the additional relief by landlords may elect to serve notice on their landlords to take up a prescribed repayment scheme for a specified portion of rental arrears accumulated from 1 Feb 2020 up till 19 Oct 2020 (corresponding to the prescribed period of relief for non-performance of contractual obligations provided for under the Act). The notice should be served no later than 19 Oct 2020.


*	Upon serving the notice, tenants must start payment of the first instalment no later than 1 Nov 2020. Under the repayment scheme, tenants can pay for a specified portion of their arrears over a period of time (up to 9 months, or the remaining term of the tenancy, whichever is shorter) in equal instalments, with the interest payable on such arrears capped at 3% per annum.


*	For commercial properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments will be 5 months’ rent. For industrial/office properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments will be 4 months’ rent.


*	If the tenant fails to make a payment under the statutory repayment scheme within a prescribed period of time, or the tenant terminates the lease or licence, or the landlord terminates the lease agreement for any other default by the tenant, the statutory repayment scheme will be cancelled, and the landlord will be entitled to:

    -   Immediate payment of all the arrears
    
    -   Take steps under the contract for rentals not paid
    
    
**s.	Can the tenant’s security deposit be used to offset other rental arrears?**

*	Subject to contractual arrangements, landlords may draw on the existing security deposits to offset accumulated rental arrears, but must leave the equivalent of 1 month of rent remaining in the security deposit.


*	If the tenant takes up a statutory repayment schedule, at the end of the repayment period, the tenant will be obliged to reinstate the security deposit to the contractual amount.


**t.	How can a tenant serve a notice on his landlord to indicate his intention to take up the statutory repayment schedule?**

*	More details will be provided in due course.


**u.	What if tenants do not comply with the repayment schedule or terminates the tenancy before the arrears are paid up?**

*	All outstanding arrears, including interest and other charges, will be accelerated and immediately payable in accordance with the terms of the original contract, and the landlord will be entitled to exercise any of the landlord’s rights under the contract for non-payment of rent and the interest and other specified charges if:


    a)	Instalment payments under the scheme are not paid within a prescribed time after they become due;
    
    
    b)	The tenant terminates or repudiates his lease agreement during the rescheduled repayment period; or
    

    c)	The lease agreement is terminated due to other defaults by the tenant.


*	Tenants who have rescheduled the payment of arrears will have to provide specified documents and information to their landlords if: (a) the lease agreement is terminated or repudiated during the repayment period; and (b) there are 2 or more rescheduled repayment instalments outstanding. 


*	The documents and information to be provided will include filing a statutory declaration on their statement of accounts from April 2020 until the termination or repudiation of the lease. The tenant will also be required to set out how he proposes to repay the outstanding rental arrears.
