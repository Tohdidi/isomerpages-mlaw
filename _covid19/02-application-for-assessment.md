### Application for an Assessor’s Determination ###

You should only make an application for an Assessor’s Determination (“Application”) if you are unable to come to an agreement with the other party or parties to the contract. 

Please note that the outcome of the Application will be final. There will be no appeals from the Assessor’s determination. 

##### Step 1: Applicant Applies for an Assessor's Determination #####
Any party or parties to the contract who wish to apply for an Assessor’s determination (“the Applicant”) must submit to the Registrar an Application after serving or being served the Notification for Relief:
* For Applicants who are individuals, please use this link (SingPass).
* For Applicants which are business entities, please use this link (CorpPass).

The Application must be accompanied by:
* A copy of the Notification for Relief;
* A copy of the contract or, if there is no written contract, a description of how the contract was made and the relevant terms of the contract; and
* Any other supporting documents.

Currently, an Application for Assessment can be submitted at no cost.


##### Step 2: Registrar Reviews Application for Assessment #####
The Registrar will review the Application.

If the Registrar is satisfied that the Application is in order, the Registrar will send the Applicant:
* An acknowledgment of receipt of the Application; and
* A Response or link to the Response form that the Respondent (i.e. the other party or parties to the contract) must submit to the Registrar.

##### Step 3: Applicant Serves Documents on Respondent #####
Within <b>2 working days</b> after receiving the documents from the Registrar in Step 2, the Applicant must serve a copy of the <b>Application for Assessment</b>, together with <b>the documents received from the Registrar in Step 2</b>, on the following parties where applicable:
* The party to the contract who had served the <b>Notification for Relief</b> or the party to the contract who was served the Notification for Relief (“<b>the Respondent</b>”);
* Every other party to the contract; 
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligation in the contract; and
* The Issuer of Related Performance Bond.

The documents can be served on the Respondent by:
* Email; or
* Other modes of service set out in the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts) Regulations 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/covid19tma2020#P12-){:target="_blank"}.

##### Step 4: Applicant Submits Declaration of Service #####
The Applicant must submit to the Registrar a <b>Declaration of Service</b> demonstrating that the documents in Step 3 have been served on the relevant parties, within <b>1 working day</b> of completing Step 3:
* For Applicants who are individuals, please use this link (SingPass).
* For Applicants which are business entities, please use this link (CorpPass).

##### Step 5: Respondent Submits Response #####
The Respondent must submit a <b>Response</b> to the Registrar and serve the <b>Response</b> on the following parties where applicable within <b>5 working days</b> after being served the documents in Step 3:
* The Applicant
* The guarantor or surety of the obligation; and
* The Issuer of a Related Performance Bond.

To submit and serve the <b>Response</b>:
* For Respondents who are individuals, please use this link (SingPass).
* For Respondents which are business entities, please use this link (CorpPass).

Please note that if the Respondent fails to submit a <b>Response</b>, the Assessor may proceed to make a determination on the <b>Application</b>, which will be binding on all parties to the <b>Application</b>.

##### Step 6: Registrar Sets Appointment for Hearing #####
If the Registrar is satisfied that Steps 3, 4 and 5 have been duly completed, the Registrar will send to the Applicant and Respondent by way of email:
* A notice of the appointment of an Assessor; and
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.

Please note that the Registrar may proceed to appoint an Assessor and to fix a hearing where the Respondent fails to file a <b>Response</b> within the relevant period in Step 5. 

##### Step 7: Assessor Conducts Hearing and Makes Determination #####
The hearing will generally be conducted by way of <u>exchange of emails</u> if the Assessor is of the opinion that the forms and documents are sufficient for the Assessor to make their determination. The Assessor may request for clarifications or further documents by email.

If the Assessor is of the opinion that the interest of justice would be better served by an <u>online or physical hearing</u>:
* Online hearings will be conducted via Webex.
* Physical hearings will be held at the State Courts Towers (1 Havelock Square, Singapore 059724) or other venue as advised by the Registrar.

Please note for online or physical hearings:
* An Assessor may permit a party to be accompanied by an interpreter at the hearing. The party will be responsible for sourcing their own interpreter.
* No party may be represented by an advocate and solicitor at proceedings before an Assessor.

If a party to a determination is <u>absent</u> from the hearing, the Assessor may dismiss the application or make a determination on the case.

If the party had a good reason for being absent, they may make an application to set aside the dismissal or determination made in their absence. See <b>Form 10</b> Application to Set Aside a Dismissal or Determination.
