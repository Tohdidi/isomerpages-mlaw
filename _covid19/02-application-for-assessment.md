### Application for an Assessor’s Determination ###

You should only make an application for an Assessor’s Determination (“Application”) if you are unable to come to an agreement with the other party or parties to the contract. 

Please note that the outcome of the Application will be final. There will be no appeals from the Assessor’s determination. 

##### Step 1: Applicant Applies for an Assessor's Determination #####
Any party or parties to the contract who wish to apply for an Assessor’s determination (“the Applicant”) must submit to the Registrar an Application after serving or being served the Notification for Relief:
* For Applicants who are individuals, please use this link (SingPass).

The Application must be accompanied by:
* A copy of the Notification for Relief;
* A copy of the contract or, if there is no written contract, a description of how the contract was made and the relevant terms of the contract; and
* Any other supporting documents.

Currently, an Application for Assessment can be submitted at no cost.


##### Step 2: Registrar Reviews Application for Assessment #####
The Registrar will review the Application.

If the Registrar is satisfied that the Application is in order, the Registrar will send the Applicant:
* An acknowledgment of receipt of the Application; and
* A Response or link to the Response form that the Respondent (i.e. the other party or parties to the contract) must submit to the Registrar.

##### Step 3: Applicant Serves Documents on Respondent #####

##### Step 4: Applicant Submits Declaration of Service #####
