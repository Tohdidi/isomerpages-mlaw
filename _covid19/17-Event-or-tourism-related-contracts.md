### 1. Event or tourism-related contracts ###

#### General FAQs ####
a. What is an event contract? 

* An “event contract” is a contract for the provision of a venue, accommodation, amenities, transport, entertainment, catering or other goods and services for an event, such as a business meeting, conference, wedding etc. 

  * E.g. contract with hotel for a wedding banquet, contract for photography services or make-up services for a wedding, contract for tickets to a concert or show or sporting event.

* The event contract must be governed by Singapore law.

b. What is a tourism-related contract?

* A “tourism-related contract” is a contract –

  * For sea and land travel (e.g. cruises)

  * For the provision of transport, short-term accommodation, entertainment, dining, catering, tours or other tourism-related goods or services for visitors to Singapore, domestic or outbound tourists

  * For the promotion of tourism in Singapore or the distribution of products related to tourism for the purposes of trade or retail.

* A tourism-related contract does not include a contract for air travel such as airline tickets. 

* The tourism-related contract must be governed by Singapore law. 

c. Does the Act apply to my event or tourism-related contract? 

* The Act applies to event or tourism-related contracts if: 

  * The contract was entered into before 25 March 2020
  * The contractual obligation is to be performed on or after 1 February 2020 (e.g. the wedding banquet was to be provided on 14 April 2020) 
  * The contractual obligation could not be performed due to COVID-19 (e.g. wedding could not be held on 14 April 2020 because of the “circuit-breaker” measures)

* You will need to serve a Notification for Relief on the other party to the contract to enjoy the reliefs under the Act.

d. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me? 

* If you are unable to carry out your contractual obligation due to COVID-19, the other party to the contract cannot take take legal action against you in respect of that obligation during the prescribed period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020).

* Further, if the Act applies to your contract, the deposit you have placed with the vendor for that contract cannot be automatically forfeited. If a deposit has purportedly been been forfeited, it must be restored. 

  * This does not mean that you are automatically entitled to cancel the contract, nor does it mean that deposits are automatically refunded to you. 

  * Instead, we encourage you to discuss with the vendor and work out an arrangement which is mutually acceptable. For example, you may agree to hold your event after the COVID-19 pandemic, in which case the vendor has no reason to forfeit the deposit. In this case, the deposit will remain with the vendor.

  * If you and your vendor cannot reach a resolution, either of you can apply to an Assessor, who will make a determination that is just and equitable in the circumstances. You can find more information on the assessment process at [insert link to FAQs on Assessors].

* In addition, the other party to the contract cannot start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings against you for 6 months (i.e. up to 19 October 2020) if you are unable to perform your obligations due to COVID-19.
