### 1. Event or tourism-related contracts ###

#### General FAQs ####
a. What is an event contract? 

* An “event contract” is a contract for the provision of a venue, accommodation, amenities, transport, entertainment, catering or other goods and services for an event, such as a business meeting, conference, wedding etc. 

  * E.g. contract with hotel for a wedding banquet, contract for photography services or make-up services for a wedding, contract for tickets to a concert or show or sporting event.

* The event contract must be governed by Singapore law.

b. What is a tourism-related contract?

* A “tourism-related contract” is a contract –

  * For sea and land travel (e.g. cruises)

  * For the provision of transport, short-term accommodation, entertainment, dining, catering, tours or other tourism-related goods or services for visitors to Singapore, domestic or outbound tourists

  * For the promotion of tourism in Singapore or the distribution of products related to tourism for the purposes of trade or retail.

* A tourism-related contract does not include a contract for air travel such as airline tickets. 

* The tourism-related contract must be governed by Singapore law. 

c. Does the Act apply to my event or tourism-related contract? 

* The Act applies to event or tourism-related contracts if: 

  * The contract was entered into before 25 March 2020
  * The contractual obligation is to be performed on or after 1 February 2020 (e.g. the wedding banquet was to be provided on 14 April 2020) 
  * The contractual obligation could not be performed due to COVID-19 (e.g. wedding could not be held on 14 April 2020 because of the “circuit-breaker” measures)

* You will need to serve a Notification for Relief on the other party to the contract to enjoy the reliefs under the Act.

d. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me? 

* If you are unable to carry out your contractual obligation due to COVID-19, the other party to the contract cannot take legal action against you in respect of that obligation during the prescribed period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020).

* Further, if the Act applies to your contract, the deposit you have placed with the vendor for that contract cannot be automatically forfeited. If a deposit has purportedly been forfeited, it must be restored. 

  * This does not mean that you are automatically entitled to cancel the contract, nor does it mean that deposits are automatically refunded to you. 

  * Instead, we encourage you to discuss with the vendor and work out an arrangement which is mutually acceptable. For example, you may agree to hold your event after the COVID-19 pandemic, in which case the vendor has no reason to forfeit the deposit. In this case, the deposit will remain with the vendor.

  * If you and your vendor cannot reach a resolution, either of you can apply to an Assessor, who will make a determination that is just and equitable in the circumstances. You can find more information on the assessment process at [insert link to FAQs on Assessors].

* In addition, the other party to the contract cannot start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings against you for 6 months (i.e. up to 19 October 2020) if you are unable to perform your obligations due to COVID-19. 

e. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs? 

* The reliefs under the Act do not take effect automatically. 

* If you qualify for the relief, you need to first serve a Notification for Relief on the other party to the contract, using the form at [insert link].

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the other party to the contract, the reliefs in (d) above will apply.

#### Specific FAQs ####
I am a consumer in an event/tourism-related contract…

f. What happens if my vendor/tour agency has already forfeited my deposit before I served a Notification for Relief? 

* Once a Notification for Relief has been served, the vendor/tour agency has to restore your deposit, even if it has been previously forfeited.

* This applies to contracts entered into before 25 March 2020, for obligationson or after 1 February 2020.  For example, the Act would apply to a contract which you entered into in June 2019 to book a wedding banquet to be held on 20 February 2020. 

* A restoration of deposit does not mean that you are entitled to cancel the contract, and/or that the vendor/tour agency must provide you with a refund automatically. 

g. My deposit was forfeited before the Act came into force on [20 April 2020]. Do I have any recourse under the Act? 

* If the contract was entered into before 25 March 2020, and the event or tour was supposed to be carried out on or after 1 February 2020, but could not be carried out because of COVID-19, your deposit can still be restored. 

* You must first serve a Notification for Relief on the vendor. Upon the receipt of the Notification for Relief, the vendor must restore the forfeited deposit as soon as practicable. 

* Restoration does not mean that the deposit is paid back to you.  It means that the deposit continues to be held by the vendor, pending a mutual agreement on how the deposit is to be dealt with, or if an agreement is not possible, a determination by an Assessor.

* This is unless you had already cancelled the event, and agreed with the vendor that the deposit (or a part of it) is to be forfeited. 

h. I do not wish to postpone my event or tour, but wish to cancel it. Can I recover my deposit? Is the vendor entitled to charge the cancellation fees as provided under the contract? 

* With respect to the deposit, we encourage you to discuss with your vendor and work out an arrangement which is mutually acceptable. This may include a partial recovery of the deposit. If you and your vendor are unable to agree, either of you may apply to an Assessor, who will make a determination which is just and equitable.

* With respect to the cancellation fees, under the Act, you do not have to pay the cancellation fees if the event or tour was to occur between 1 February 2020 and 19 October 2020 (both dates inclusive). However, if you already paid the cancellation fees before the Act came into force on [20 April 2020], or before serving the Notification for Relief, the vendor is not obliged to return the paid cancellation fees.

i. I prepaid for my event or tour. Does the Act apply to prepayments as well? 

* It is possible that the prepayment may be considered a deposit for the purposes of the Act. This depends on the terms of your contract. If the prepayment is considered a deposit for the purposes of the Act, the reliefs applicable to deposits will apply (see (d)). 

* If you and your vendor are unable to reach an agreement, either of you may apply to an Assessor, who will make a determination that is just and equitable. This determination can potentially include a determination that the prepayment is considered a deposit for the purposes of the Act, and should be restored and how it should be dealt with.

j. My event or tour is to occur after [19 October 2020] (i.e. more than 6 months after the Act comes into force). Does the Act apply to me? 

* Yes, but only if the contract was entered into before 25 March 2020, and now cannot be carried out because of COVID-19. In this case, your vendor cannot forfeit your deposit, even if your event or tour is scheduled after [19 October 2020]. 

* However, if you wish to cancel your booking, your vendor can charge you the cancellation fees as provided for in the contract. Your deposit cannot be automatically forfeited, although this does not mean it will be automatically refunded to you. 

* We encourage you to discuss with the vendor and work out an arrangement which is mutually acceptable. 

* If you and your vendor cannot reach a resolution, either of you can apply to an Assessor, who will make a determination that is just and equitable in the circumstances. You can find more information on the assessment process at [insert link to FAQs on Assessors].

k. Are air tickets covered under the Act? 

* Air tickets are not covered by the Act. Most airlines have their own refund or cancellation policy.  You should check the airline’s refund or cancellation policies..

i. Does the Act cover bookings made on travel intermediaries (e.g. online platforms for hotel/tour bookings)? 

* Bookings on travel intermediaries (such as aggregate booking websites) will be covered under the Act if these bookings were made under Singapore law. 

* Whether the booking was made under Singapore law depends on the terms and conditions of your booking. 

m. My vendor returned my deposit in the form of vouchers. Can I ask for cash instead? 

* The Act does not mandate how the deposit should be returned. We encourage you to discuss with your vendor and work out an arrangement which is mutually acceptable. If you are unable to agree, either of you may apply to the Assessor. It is possible that the Assessor may determine that giving vouchers rather than cash is a just and equitable outcome.

I am an event provider/travel agency…

n. I am an event provider/vendor and I have already provided some services pursuant to the event contract, must I provide a full refund if I receive a Notification for Relief? 

* The Act does not mandate that service providers provide full refunds to consumers. We encourage parties to discuss and work out an arrangement which is mutually acceptable.

* If parties are unable to agree, either party may apply to the Assessor. It is possible that if you have provided services to the consumer (e.g. wedding photoshoot, deliveries) or incurred expenses for the purposes of the event (e.g. purchasing perishables), then an Assessor may make a determination based on the circumstances of the case, on a just and equitable basis, that only part of the deposit be restored.
