**b. What is the difference between a rental agreement and a hire-purchase agreement?**

* Broadly speaking, in a hire-purchase agreement, ownership of the good passes to the hirer after the payment of all the instalments. 
* In a rental agreement, ownership of the good does not pass to the renter.
*	If you are unsure of the nature of your contract, you should seek legal advice.


**c. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the hirer/debtor?**

* If you are **unable to pay** instalments on the hire-purchase agreement **due to COVID-19**, the financing company cannot take the following actions against you for 6 months (i.e. up to 19 October 2020): 

  * Repossess the plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for business, or repossess your commercial vehicle.
  * Start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings.

**d. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?** 

* The reliefs under the Act **do not take effect automatically.**

*  If you qualify for the relief, you need to first **serve a Notification for Relief** on the financial company, and your guarantor/surety (if any), using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass){:target="_blank"} or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass){:target="_blank"}.

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the financial company, the financing company cannot take the above actions in (c).

#### Specific FAQs ####

Types of agreements and vehicles which the Act applies to

**e. I am a private-hire driver and purchased my car through a hire-purchase agreement. I am unable to afford my monthly instalments due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Yes, the Act applies to hire-purchase agreements where the good hired or conditionally sold under the agreement is a commercial vehicle. This includes chauffeur-driven private-hire cars (with blue decals).

**f. Does the Act apply to me if I use my vehicle partly for commercial purposes and partly for personal use?**

* It depends on whether your vehicle is a commercial vehicle. Please refer to paragraph (b).

* A car registered as a chauffeur-driven private hire car (with blue decals) would be considered a commercial vehicle. 

* A personal vehicle used for travel to and from a place of work is not a commercial vehicle.

**g. I am taxi driver or a private-hire driver who rented my car or taxi from a car rental company. I am unable to afford my monthly rent due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me?**

* No, the Act does not apply to rental agreements for private-hire cars or taxis. 

* However, the Government has worked closely with the industry and the associations to provide targeted relief to help drivers tide over this challenging period. We have set out more information on these relief measures below:
  * <u>Special Relief Fund (SRF)</u>. Eligible active drivers can receive relief of $300 per vehicle per month to defray business costs. Please click on this [link](http://www.go.gov.sg/ppsp2){:target="_blank"} for further information. 
  * <u>Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS)</u>. Drivers who are eligible for the SIRS can also receive $1,000 per month for nine months (or $9,000 in total). Please click on this [link](http://www.ntuc.com.sg/sirs){:target="_blank"} for further information.
  * <u>Courier/Delivery service</u>. From now till end-September, taxi and private-hire car drivers may deliver food and groceries to supplement their income and cushion the decline in ridership. Please contact your operator for more information.
  * <u>Enhanced training support</u>. To help drivers upskill, the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has enhanced course fee support of up to 90% for selected courses. This applies until the end of 2020. Under the Self-Employed Persons (SEP) Training Support Scheme administered by the NTUC, drivers can also receive at least $10 per hour when they attend sector-specific training programmes.

Eligibility and scope of the relief

**h. My business suffered a drop of revenue due to COVID-19. Under the Act, must I still continue paying the instalments?** 

* The instalment continues to be payable. However, the Act prevents the financing company from repossessing the plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for business or commercial vehicle, or commencing or continuing legal action during the prescribed period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020). This gives the hirer and the financing company time to negotiate a mutually acceptable way to deal with the arrears.

* The relief applies only to hirers who can demonstrate that they are unable to pay the instalments due to COVID-19. It does not allow hirers who are able to pay to avoid paying. Hirers who have the ability to pay (even if they suffered a drop in revenue) must continue to pay the instalment.

**i. I was unable to pay the instalment that fell due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to arrears from before 1 February 2020?** 

* No, the Act applies only to the inability to pay the instalments due to COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 onwards. The financing company is entitled to enforce any contractual rights they have for unpaid instalments due before 1 February 2020.

**j. I am unable to pay the instalment due to COVID-19. Should I issue a Notification for Relief or apply for an Assessor’s determination under the Act?**

* If you have been affected by COVID-19, and are unable to perform your contractual obligations, we would encourage you to work together with your financing company to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 

* For both parties, a settlement is preferable to being mired in costly and lengthy legal proceedings.

* If you cannot reach an agreement yet and require protection from legal proceedings, you may serve a Notification for Relief on your financing company, who is then prohibited from taking any of the actions in (c). This will give you temporary protection up to 19 October 2020.

* For the avoidance of doubt, the instalment continues to accrue in the interim.  You are therefore encouraged to use the temporary relief period to work out a solution. 

* In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to pay the instalment, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on [link](/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.

**k. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid instalments (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period?**

* Yes.  The unpaid instalments (and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment, if provided for under the contract) continues to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. 

* The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, but seeks to temporarily prohibit the financing company from enforcing the contract during the relief period.

* While this gives the hirer  some breathing space without the threat of repossession or litigation to sort out his finances, he may be subject to a higher outstanding amount at the end of the temporary relief period as the interest or fees for late payment continues to accrue under his contract with the financing company. 

* As such, hirers are encouraged to engage their financing companies to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution. 

**l. Can a financing company charge the hirer interest or other fees for late payment during the relief period, after the hirer serves the Notification for Relief?**

* The Act does not remove or absolve parties' contractual obligations. If the agreement provides that the financing company can charge interest or charges (be it for late payment or otherwise), those charges would accrue and can be enforced by the financing company after the relief period. 

* However, the financing company may <b><u>not</u> unilaterally increase the charges payable by the hirer</b>.  See (m).

**m. The financing company says that it is exercising its right to increase the interest payable under the hire-purchase agreement.  Can it do so?**

* If a hirer has served a Notification for Relief on the financing company, under the Act, the financing company is not permitted to:

  * <b>Increase any charges or interest rate payable under the contract unless such increase (i) is specified in the contract; (ii) is calculated by reference to a formula (e.g. a reference rate) in the contract; (iii)  relates to expenses reasonably incurred by the financing company in the ordinary course of business; or (iv) is further agreed to by the hirer.</b> 

  * <b>Impose new charges except with the further agreement of the hirer.</b>

* The table below illustrates when an increase in interest rate or charges, or an imposition of new charges or interest, is or is not permitted. 

|  **Example**  |  **Permitted**  |  **Not Permitted** |
|--|--|--| 
|Contract provides that the financing company may charge “_an additional x% p.a. or such other rate as it may in its discretion prescribe_” on overdue payments.|Financing company can charge the additional x% p.a.| Financing company cannot increase the rate above the additional x% unless the hirer further agrees to the increased rate.|
|Contract provides that the financing company may charge “$_x a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full, or any such other charge at its discretion_”.|Financing company can charge $x a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full.  |Financing company cannot rely on this clause to increase the charges to more than $x a day, unless the hirer further agrees to the increased charges.|
|Contract provides that the hirer shall “_pay interest at SIBOR plus x% p.a., or such other rate as may be determined by the financing company_" in the event of default.|Financing company can charge the stipulated additional interest at SIBOR plus x% p.a.|Financing company cannot increase the rate beyond SIBOR plus x% p.a., unless the hirer further agrees to the increased rate.| 
|Contract provides that financing company may “_impose any charges at its discretion_”.|Financing company can impose charges where it relates to expenses that it has reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, e.g. administrative charges (including increase) which are based on the financing company’s internal schedule of charges and are collected from other hirers with similar hire-purchase agreements.|Financing company cannot rely on this clause to impose a charge that is not reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, unless the hirer’s further consent is obtained.|
|Contract provides that the financing company "_reserves the right to vary the conditions in the agreement without the hirer’s consent_”.|-|Financing company cannot rely on this clause to increase or introduce any new interest or charges, unless the hirer’s further consent is obtained.|

**n. My financing company repossessed my commercial vehicle before the Act commenced. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Part 2 of the Act on Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts commenced on 20 April 2020. It does not apply to repossessions that occurred before that date. 

* If you believe that the financing company breached the terms of your hire-purchase agreement, please seek legal advice.
