#### General FAQs ####

* The Act covers secured loans that are secured against:

  * commercial or industrial immovable property located in Singapore (e.g. factory premises, retail space); or 

  * plant, machinery or fixed asset in Singapore that is used for business purposes. 

* The loan must be given by a bank or finance company to an enterprise that is at least 30% owned by Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, and the turnover of the enterprise group must not exceed $100 million.  

b. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the debtor?
* If you are unable to pay instalments on your secured debt due to COVID-19, your bank or finance company cannot take the following actions against you for 6 months (i.e. up to 19 October 2020):

  * Enforce their security over your commercial or industrial property located in Singapore
  * Enforce their security over your plant, machinery or fixed asset in Singapore that is used for business purposes
  * Start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings
  
c. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs? 

* The reliefs under the Act do not take effect automatically. 

* If you qualify for the relief, you need to first serve a Notification for Relief on the bank or finance company, as well as your guarantor/surety for the loan (if any), , using the form at <insert link>.

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the bank or finance company, the bank or finance company cannot take the above actions in (b).  

#### Specific FAQs ####
d. My business suffered a drop in revenue due to COVID-19. Under the Act, must I still continue paying for the instalments on my loans? 

* The instalments continue to be payable.  However, if you are unable to pay instalments due to COVID-19, the Act prevents the lender from taking the actions in (b) to enforce the payment.  This is intended to give the lender and borrower time to negotiate a mutually acceptable way to deal with the instalments and arrears.
* It does not allow debtors who are able to pay to avoid paying instalments. Debtors who have the ability to pay (even if they suffered a drop in revenue) must continue to pay instalments for their secured loans.

e. I was unable to pay instalments for my secured loan that were due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to me? 

* No, the Act applies only to the inability to pay instalments on secured loans due to COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 onwards. The bank or finance company is entitled to enforce any contractual rights they have for your unpaid instalments before 1 February 2020.

f. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid instalments (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period? 

* The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, but merely seeks to suspend the creditor’s right to enforce the contract during the relief period. This gives the debtor some breathing space without the threat of enforcement of security or litigation to sort out his finances, and time for the creditor and debtor to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable solution. 

* Yes, the unpaid instalments (and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment if provided for under the contract) continues to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period.

  * However, parties are encouraged to work out a compromise on the arrears and the terms of the loan so that they can preserve a longer-term relationship which is beneficial to both parties.

* Other than the Act, your SME may be eligible for MAS and the financial industry’s relief measures to support SMEs with continued access to bank credit. Amongst other things, SMEs may opt to defer principal payments on their secured term loans up to 31 December 2020, subject to the banks’ and finance companies’ assessment of the quality of the SME’s security. SMEs will also be able to extend the tenure of their loans by up to the corresponding principal deferment period if they wish. This relief will be available to SMEs that continue to pay interest and are in good standing with their banks and finance companies (not more than 90 days past due as of 6 April 2020).

g. Are unsecured loans (e.g. debt incurred on a corporate credit card) covered by the Act?

* No, the Act does not cover unsecured loans. 

* If your business requires financial assistance, you may wish to consider the relief measures introduced by MAS and the financial industry to help individuals and SMEs affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Amongst other things, SMEs can apply to their lenders to defer principal repayment on certain secured SME loans up to 31 December 2020, and can apply to their insurer to pay instalments for the company’s general insurance premiums.  SMEs can also apply for loan schemes supported by Enterprise Singapore. This includes the Enterprise Financing Scheme SME Working Capital Loan Scheme (EFS-WCL) and the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme.
