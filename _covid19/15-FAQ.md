### 1. Lease or licence of non-residential property ###

#### General FAQs ####
a. Does the Act cover residential leases and licences?
* The Act only covers leases and licences of non-residential (e.g. commercial or industrial) property. It does not cover leases and licences of residential property, even if these are partially or occasionally used for business purposes (e.g. a home office).

b. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the tenant?
* If you are unable to pay your rent due to COVID-19, your landlord cannot take the following actions against you for 6 months (i.e. up to 19 October 2020):

  * Terminate your lease or licence (whether by eviction or otherwise) for your non-residential property on the basis of non-payment of rent 
  * Re-enter the premises 
  * Start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings

c. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?
* The reliefs under the Act do not take effect automatically.

* If you qualify for the relief, you need to first serve a Notification for Relief on your landlord, using the form at <insert link>.

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the landlord, he/she cannot take the above actions in (b).

#### Specific FAQs ####

d. My business suffered a drop in revenue due to COVID-19. Under the Act, must I still continue paying rent?
* Rent continues to be payable.  However, the Act prevents the landlord from terminating the tenancy, evicting the tenant, or commencing legal action during the prescribed period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020).  This gives the landlord and tenant time to negotiate a mutually acceptable way to deal with the arrears.

* The relief applies only to tenants who can demonstrate that they are unable to pay rent due to COVID-19. It does not allow tenants who are able to pay to avoid paying rent. Tenants who have the ability to pay (even if they suffered a drop in revenue) must continue to pay their rent.

e. I was unable to pay rent that was due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to arrears from before 1 February 2020?
* No, the Act applies only to the inability to pay rent due to COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 onwards. Your landlord is entitled to enforce any contractual rights they have for your unpaid rent before 1 February 2020. 

f. I was unable to pay rent that was due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to arrears from before 1 February 2020?
* If you have been affected by COVID-19, and unable to perform your contractual obligations, we would encourage you to work together with your landlord to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. Such mutually acceptable solutions can include temporary rent reduction, partial payments, or setting off arrears against the security deposit.

* For both parties, a settlement is preferable to being mired in costly and lengthy legal proceedings.

* If you cannot reach an agreement yet and require protection from legal proceedings, you may issue a Notification of Relief to your landlord, who is then prohibited from taking any of the actions in (b).  This will give you temporary protection up to 19 October 2020.

* For the avoidance of doubt, the rent continues to accrue in the interim.  You are therefore encouraged to use the period of the temporary protection to work out a solution. 

* In the event of a dispute over the Notification for Relief, either party.

g. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid rent (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period?

* The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, but merely seeks to suspend the landlord’s right to enforce the contract during the relief period. This gives the tenant some breathing space without the threat of eviction or litigation to sort out his finances, and time for the landlord and tenant to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable solution. The unpaid rent (and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment if provided for under the contract) therefore continues to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period.  

* However, parties are encouraged to work out a compromise on the rental arrears and the terms of the tenancy so that they can preserve a longer-term relationship which is beneficial to both parties.
