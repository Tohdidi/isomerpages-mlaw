### Lease or licence of non-residential property – Temporary Relief from Contractual Obligations ###

<u>Important Note</u>: This set of FAQs only addresses questions relating to the temporary relief from contractual obligations under Part 2 of the Act which were originally introduced in April 2020.  If you have questions on the rental relief framework for SMEs reliefs under Part 2A of the Act which were introduced in June 2020, please click

* [here](../covid19-relief/rental-relief) for the rental relief framework

#### General FAQs ####
**1. Does the Act cover residential leases and licences?**
* The Act only covers leases and licences of non-residential (e.g. commercial or industrial) property. It does not cover leases and licences of residential property, even if these are partially or occasionally used for business purposes (e.g. a home office).

**2. Is a shophouse covered by the Act?**
* The commercial component of a shophouse is covered by the Act, while the residential component is not.

**3. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the tenant?**
* If you are **unable to pay** your rent **due to COVID-19**, your landlord cannot take the following actions against you for up to 19 October 2020:

  * Terminate your lease or licence (whether by eviction or otherwise) for your non-residential property on the basis of non-payment of rent. 
  * Unilaterally impose new charges, increase charges or interest rates beyond what is provided for in the lease or licence agreement (see FAQ (12) & (13)).
  * Re-enter the premises. 
  * Start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings.

**4. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?**
* The reliefs under Part 2 of the Act in relation to inability to perform contractual obligations **do not take effect automatically.**

* If you qualify for the relief, you need to first **serve a Notification for Relief** on your landlord, using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass){:target="_blank"} or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass){:target="_blank"}.

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the landlord, he/she cannot take the above actions in FAQ(3).

**5. What kind of obligations does the Act cover? Is it only limited to the payment of rent?**
* No, the Act covers all contractual obligations which a party is unable to perform due to COVID-19. These may include the payment of rent, payment of security deposit, or the obligation to reinstate the property by a certain time by the tenant. It may also include obligations by the landlord such as the obligation to deliver vacant possession by a stipulated time.

**6. How does the Frustrated Contracts Act, and a force majeure clause in the lease or licence agreement interact with the Act?**
* The Act does not affect the taking of any action in relation to the Frustrated Contracts Act or a force majeure clause. The Assessors would not determine whether the Frustrated Contracts Act or a force majeure clause applies.
* Where applicable, instead of seeking relief under the Act, a party may instead rely on the doctrine of frustration or relying on a force majeure clause in the contract. Please seek legal advice if you wish to rely on the Frustrated Contracts Act or a force majeure clause.

#### Specific FAQs ####

<u>I am a tenant…</u>

**7. My lease or licence was entered into after 25 March 2020. Does the Act apply to me?**
* The Act does not apply to any lease or licence entered into after 25 March 2020, but does apply to a lease or licence that is: 
 * Renewed automatically after 25 March 2020
 * Renewed after 25 March 2020 in the exercise of a right of renewal provided in the lease or licence.

**8. My lease or licence ends before 19 October 2020. Does the Act apply to me?**
* A lease or licence entered into before 25 March 2020 would be covered by the Act, regardless of when the term of the lease or licence ends. 

**9. My business suffered a drop in revenue due to COVID-19. Under the Act, must I still continue paying rent?**
* Rent (less the [rental waiver granted under the rental relief framework for SMEs](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes) in Part 2A of the Act) continues to be payable.  However, the Act prevents the landlord from terminating the tenancy, evicting the tenant, or commencing or continuing legal action during the relief period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020).  This gives the landlord and tenant time to negotiate a mutually acceptable way to deal with the arrears.

* The relief applies only to tenants who can demonstrate that they are **unable to pay** rent due to COVID-19. It does not allow tenants who are able to pay to avoid paying rent. Tenants who have the ability to pay (even if they suffered a drop in revenue) must continue to pay their rent.

**10. I was unable to pay rent that was due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to arrears from before 1 February 2020?**
* No, Part 2 of the Act applies only to the inability to pay rent due to COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 onwards. Your landlord is entitled to enforce any contractual rights they have for unpaid rent due before 1 February 2020. 

**11. I was unable to pay rent due to COVID-19. Should I issue a Notification for Relief or apply for an Assessor's determination under the Act?**
* If you have been affected by COVID-19, and are unable to perform your contractual obligations, we would encourage you to work together with your landlord to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. Such mutually acceptable solutions can include temporary rent reduction, partial payments, or setting off arrears against the security deposit.

* For both parties, a settlement is preferable to being mired in costly and lengthy legal proceedings.

* If you cannot reach an agreement yet and require protection from legal proceedings, you may serve a Notification for Relief on your landlord, who is then prohibited from taking any of the actions in FAQ(3).  This will give you temporary protection up to 19 October 2020.

* For the avoidance of doubt, the rent (less the [rental waiver granted under the rental relief framework for SMEs](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes) in Part 2A of the Act) continues to accrue in the interim.  You are therefore encouraged to use the temporary relief period to work out a solution. 

* In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to pay rent, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on this [link](/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.

**12. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid rent (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period?**

* Yes, the unpaid rent (less the [rental waiver granted under the rental relief framework for SMEs](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes) in Part 2A of the Act) and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment, if provided for under the contract continue to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. 

* Part 2 of the Act seeks to temporarily prohibit the landlord from enforcing the contract during the relief period. 

* This gives the tenant some breathing space without the threat of eviction or litigation to sort out his finances, and time for the landlord and tenant to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable solution. Parties are encouraged to work out a compromise on the rental arrears and the terms of the tenancy so that they can preserve a longer-term relationship which is beneficial to both parties. 

**13. Can a landlord charge the tenant interest or other fees for late payment during the relief period, after the tenant serves the Notification for Relief?**

* If the agreement provides that the landlord can charge interest or charges (be it for late payment or otherwise), those charges would accrue and can be enforced by the landlord after the relief period. 

* However, the landlord may <b><u>not</u> unilaterally increase the charges payable by the tenant</b>.  See FAQ(14).

**14. The landlord says that it is exercising its right to increase the late payment interest and other charges under the tenancy.  Can it do so?**

* If a tenant has served a Notification for Relief on the landlord, under the Act, the landlord is not permitted to:

  * <b>Increase any charges or interest rate payable under the lease or licence agreement unless such increase (i) is specified in the agreement; (ii) is calculated by reference to a formula (e.g. a reference rate) in the agreement;  (iii)  relates to expenses reasonably incurred by the landlord in the ordinary course of business; or (iv) is further agreed to by the tenant. </b>

  * <b> Impose new charges including late payment charges except with the further agreement of the tenant. </b>

* The table below illustrates when an increase in interest rate or charges, or an imposition of new charges or interest, is or is not permitted. 

|  **Example**  |  **Permitted**  |  **Not Permitted** |
|--|--|--| 
|Lease or licence agreement provides that the landlord may charge “_an additional x% p.a. or such other rate as it may in its discretion prescribe_” on overdue rent.|Landlord can charge the additional x% p.a.| Landlord cannot increase the rate above the additional x% unless the tenant further agrees to the increased rate.|
|Lease or licence agreement provides that the landlord may charge “$_x a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full, or any such other charge at its discretion_”.|Landlord can charge $x a day for each day the rental payment is not satisfied in full.  |Landlord cannot rely on this clause to increase the charges to more than $x a day, unless the tenant further agrees to the increased charges.|
|Lease or licence agreement provides that landlord may “_impose any charges at its discretion_”.|Landlord can impose charges where it relates to expenses that it has reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, e.g. administrative charges.|Landlord cannot rely on this clause to impose a charge that is not reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, unless the tenant’s further consent is obtained.|
|Lease or licence agreement provides that the landlord "_reserves the right to vary the conditions in the agreement without the tenant’s consent_”.|-|Landlord cannot rely on this clause to increase or introduce any new interest or charges, unless the tenant’s further consent is obtained.|

**15. After serving the Notification for Relief, my landlord deducted from the security deposit, even though I did not agree to it. Is my landlord allowed to do that?**

* The Act does not prohibit the landlord from deducting rental arrears against the security deposit.  Whether the landlord is entitled to do so depends on the terms of the lease.
* You should engage your landlord in negotiations to work out a mutually acceptable agreement on how to deal with rental arrears. We encourage landlords and tenants to be reasonable and to work out a mutually acceptable solution to the contractual issues that have been created by COVID-19.

**16. What can I do if my landlord threatens to evict me/terminate my lease or licence after I have served a Notification for Relief?**

*	After you serve a Notification for Relief in accordance with the Act, it is unlawful and an offence for your landlord to exercise a right of re-entry or to terminate the lease for non-payment of rent, or start court or insolvency proceedings against you. 
*	We encourage you to reach out to your landlord to confirm that he had received your Notification for Relief, and to commence negotiations with your landlord to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
* If no agreement is reached, and the landlord does not agree that you are entitled to relief under the Act (and wish to proceed with re-entry, termination of the lease, or commencement of court or insolvency proceedings), either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will determine whether the relief is applicable. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and relevant forms. 

**17. My landlord terminated my lease / evicted me before the Act commenced. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Part 2 of the [Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/covid19tma2020){:target="_blank"} commenced on 20 April 2020. It does not apply to terminations or evictions that occurred before that date. 

* If you believe that your landlord has breached the terms of the tenancy agreement, please seek legal advice.  

**18. I wish to terminate my lease or licence early, without having to forfeit my security deposit or without being liable for the remaining term of the lease or licence. Does the Act assist me?** 

* The Act does not change the terms of your contract with your landlord in relation to termination of the lease or licence. If the contract provides for charges or other fees for early termination, you will still be liable to pay those charges or fees to your landlord as provided under the contract, unless you and your landlord agree otherwise.

* Your landlord may also be entitled to set off the security deposit against any damages that you might have to pay if you have breached your tenancy agreement. 

* If you have been unable to pay any rent that is due on or after 1 February 2020 due to COVID-19, and have served a Notification for Relief on your landlord, your landlord cannot enforce the contract for rent until after 19 October 2020. Please note that your landlord can still take legal action against you for the unpaid rent after 19 October 2020.
