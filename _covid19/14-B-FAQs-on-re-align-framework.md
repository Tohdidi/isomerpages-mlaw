#### <a name="secta">A. Overview of Relief Measures</a> <a href="#refa" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####
<a name="q1">**1. Why has the Government decided to implement these relief measures?** </a><a href="#a1" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on businesses. Although economic and social activities have now resumed in a careful and calibrated manner, safe distancing requirements and travel restrictions continue to seriously affect the viability of some businesses.  

* As the assumptions upon which these businesses entered their contracts before COVID-19 have fundamentally changed, they may need to review their contractual obligations. However, they may be deterred from renegotiating or exiting their contracts by the sizable penalties or damages they may incur. 
* The Act therefore seeks to provide a simple and targeted legislative framework to enable these businesses to renegotiate or subsequently terminate specified types of contracts with their counterparties.
* This allows businesses to re-align quickly in a just and fair manner and move forward in this vastly changed business environment. Overall, this will be beneficial for businesses if they are enabled to pivot or downscale their operations more quickly, and more productive for the economy.   

<a name="q2">**2. What do the relief measures broadly seek to do?** </a><a href="#a2" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* Renegotiation: Provide a simple and targeted legislative framework to allow businesses which have experienced a substantial change in circumstances due to COVID-19, to renegotiate certain prescribed contracts with their counterparties.

* Termination: Where renegotiations fail, eligible businesses would be able to terminate certain prescribed contracts with fair and just consequences for them and their counterparties, as determined by an Assessor appointed by the Ministry of Law.

* Repayment Scheme: For certain types of contracts, the Act provides that eligible businesses may, instead of terminating, elect to pay outstanding arrears accumulated during a specified period in equal instalments over a period of up to 18 months. This Repayment Scheme is available for hire-purchase agreements, conditional sales agreements and lease agreements for commercial equipment.

#### <a name="sectb">B. Eligibility and Scope</a><a href="#refa" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####
<a name="q3">**3. Who is eligible for these relief measures?** </a><a href="#a3" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* The Act is targeted at smaller and micro enterprises whose business outlook has been severely impacted by COVID-19 even after economic and social activities have resumed. Two key criteria will be used to identify eligible businesses:

     (a)	First, businesses must fall within an annual revenue cap.  

     (b)	Second, businesses must have experienced a significant fall in revenue across a comparable time frame pre-COVID19. This will identify businesses who have been severely impacted even after the resumption of economic and social activities.

* Details will be announced later

<a name="q4">**4. Are freelancers and non-profit organisations eligible for the relief measures as well?** </a><a href="#a4" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* Yes. Individuals carrying on business or trade (e.g. freelancers) and non-profit organisations (e.g. registered or exempt charities, co-operative societies, arts and culture societies, trade associations) are eligible for the relief measures if they satisfy the relevant criteria in **[Question 3](#q3)**.

<a name="q5">**5. What types of contracts are eligible for negotiation or termination under the Act?** </a><a href="#a5" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* The Act is designed to cover key business-to-business contracts. Relief will apply to a contract which:  

     (a)	is governed by Singapore law; 

     (b)	was entered into before 25 March 2020; 

     (c)	has at least one party who has a place of business in Singapore; and

     (iii)	Hire-purchase or conditional sales agreements for commercial equipment and commercial vehicles (excluding agreements entered into with banks and financial companies regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore);
     
     (iv)	Contracts for sale and purchase of goods; and
     
     (v)	Contracts for sale and purchase of services.

<a name="q6">**6. Which contracts are excluded from the relief measures?** </a><a href="#a6" title="Return to top">↩</a> 	
* The following contracts (set out in Paragraph 2 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the Act) are excluded:

     (a)	Consumer contracts.

     (b)	Employment contracts.

     (c)	Insurance contracts

     (d)	Leases or licences for any non-residential immovable property for a term exceeding 5 years; 

     (e)	Contracts made in connection with a financial transaction, or for the supply of financial services (except hire-purchase)

     (f)	Construction or supply contracts.

     (g)	Contracts for the carriage of goods for freight by sea, land or air, including any contracts for freight forwarding and logistic services.

     (h)	Contracts for the supply, storage, transportation, collection, treatment or disposal of certain hazardous materials
   
     (i)	Commodity contracts.

     (j)	Contracts for factoring of receivables

     (k)	Contracts (or series of contracts) for the transfer for a business or part thereof as a going concern.

     (l)	Contracts where the application of the Re-Align Framework is inconsistent with Singapore’s international obligations (e.g. aircraft financing contracts falling under the Cape Town Convention)

     (m)	Contracts of national interest

<a name="q7">**7. Does the Act affect contracts which are terminated before 2 November 2020?** </a><a href="#a7" title="Return to top">↩</a>* The Act does not affect contracts:
     (a)	which are terminated before 2 November 2020; or
     (b)	where the notice for the termination of the contract was given in accordance with the contract before 2 November 2020, even if the period of the notice expires on or after that date.

<a name="q8">**8. Does this Act apply to Government contracts?** </a><a href="#a8" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Yes. Parties may renegotiate or terminate any contract which the Government is a party to, as long as it is not a contract of national interest. Please refer to [Question (22)]( #q22) below. 

<a name="q9">**9. What about restructuring arrangements entered into before 25 March 2020?** </a><a href="#a9" title="Return to top">↩</a> 	
* Where, before 25 March 2020, parties to the contract have in respect of any rights or obligations under the contract entered into:
     (a)	an arrangement or a compromise that is approved by the Court under section 210(4) of the Companies Act (Cap. 50) or section 71(1) of Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act (Act 40 of 2018); or
     (b)	 a voluntary arrangement that is approved by creditors under section 282 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act,
and the arrangement or compromise is not set aside or revoked, the arrangement or compromise is excluded from the relief measures.

<a name="q10">**10. What are the consequences of terminating a contract under the Act?** </a><a href="#a10" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Broadly, the allocation of liabilities upon termination is as follows:

     (a)	Obligations accrued on or before the date of termination remain payable and enforceable; 

     (b)	Prospective obligations after the date of termination are extinguished, subject to specific exceptions; and

     (c)	Adjustments may be made by the Assessor to achieve a fair and just outcome for all parties concerned.

* The detailed consequences of terminating a contract may be found at Part 4 of the Second Schedule to the Act [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){:target="_blank"}.

<a name="q11">**11. I am an eligible business and I am a party to a contract eligible for renegotiation or termination. What if my contract has been terminated by the other party on or after 2 November 2020, and before I had the opportunity to apply for relief? Can I still apply for relief?** </a><a href="#a11" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* Yes. If your contract was terminated by the other party on or after 2 November 2020, and before you had the opportunity to apply for relief, you will still be eligible to apply for your rights and obligations under the contract to be adjusted under the Re-Align Framework.

* You will however not be eligible for relief where:
     (a)	your contract naturally expires without a renewal of the contract; or
     (b)	your contract was automatically terminated due to the occurrence of an event and not by any action done by the other party to terminate the contract.

<a name="q12">**12. Why are the above parties in Question (11) eligible for relief under the Re-Align Framework, even when their contract had already been terminated?** </a><a href="#a12" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* This is to prevent parties from avoiding the consequences of termination under the Re-Align Framework by terminating contracts before the Act commences, and before eligible parties apply for the relief measures.

<a name="q13">**13. Is there any relief for landlords whose leases are being terminated under the Act?** </a><a href="#a13" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Yes. Similar to the Rental Relief Framework, the Re-Align Framework will seek to mitigate hardship that smaller landlords in financial hardship might face arising from the termination of the contract.

* The Assessor may determine an amount of additional compensation that the tenant will have to pay to an eligible landlord for early termination of the lease or licence agreement.

<a name="q14">**14. How do I know if I am an eligible landlord?** </a><a href="#a14" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* The details of the eligibility criteria will be provided in due course.

<a name="q15">**15. What is the eligibility criteria for the Repayment Scheme for hire-purchase agreements, conditional sales agreements and lease agreements for commercial equipment?** </a><a href="#a15" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* The eligibility criteria for the Repayment Scheme is the same as that for re-negotiating and terminating a contract.

<a name="q16">**16. Can I apply both to terminate a contract, and for the Repayment Scheme for that same contract?** </a><a href="#a16" title="Return to top">↩</a>
* No. If a party chooses to take up the Repayment Scheme, they cannot terminate the contract under the Re-Align Framework, and vice versa.

<a name="q17">**17. What outstanding arrears are covered under the Repayment Scheme?** </a><a href="#a17" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* A revised repayment schedule must include moneys that became payable under the contract (including any interest imposed on late payment) on or after 1 February 2020 and the date before the date of service of the relevant notice on your counterparty, and which remain unpaid on that date.

<a name="q18">**18. What is the maximum period I can seek to repay my outstanding arrears under the Repayment Scheme? ** </a><a href="#a18" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Eligible businesses may elect to pay the outstanding arrears in equal monthly instalments over a period of up to 18 months.

<a name="q19">**19. Is interest payable on these arrears and if so, what is the interest rate?** </a><a href="#a19" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Interest rate is payable on these arrears, capped at 5% per annum, or the contractual interest rate, whichever is lower. 

<a name="q20">**20. Must the outstanding arrears be paid in equal instalments, on a monthly basis?** </a><a href="#a20" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Yes. The outstanding arrears must be paid in equal instalments, on a monthly basis.

<a name="q21">**21. When must the first instalment be paid under the Repayment Scheme? ** </a><a href="#a21" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* The first instalment must be paid within one month after the period of six (6) weeks after the date of commencement of the Act. 

* For example, if the Act commences on 30 November 2020, the first instalment payment must be paid within the month beginning on 11 January 2021 (6 weeks after the commencement date), and ending on 11 February 2021.

<a name="q22">**22. What is a contract of national interest? How do I know whether my contract is a contract of national interest? ** </a><a href="#a22" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* A contract of national interest means:
     (a)	A contract the termination of which is likely to affect the provision of essential services or the ability of a public authority to carry out its functions, whether or not the Government or a public authority is a party to the contract; and
     (b)	The contract has been certified by a Minister to be a contract of national interest.

* An essential service means any service essential to the national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order of Singapore.

<a name="q23">**23. What support is there for me if I am a party to a contract of national interest?** </a><a href="#a23" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* While parties may not terminate contracts of national interest under the Re-Align Framework, parties may seek to renegotiate such contracts. If these renegotiations are not successful, the parties may apply to an Assessor to adjust the contract price.


<a name="q24">**24. Is there a moratorium which will stop or pause legal actions and proceedings? ** </a><a href="#a24" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* Yes. The details of the applicable moratorium for each type of application will be provided in due course. In the meantime, you may wish to refer to section [44] of the Act [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){:target="_blank"}. 

#### <a name="sectd">D. Other General Questions</a><a href="#refa" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

<a name="q29">**29. What can I do in the meantime before the Act commences?** </a><a href="#a29" title="Return to top">↩</a>	
* You may wish to start negotiating with your counterparty on the terms of the contract. The terms which you may wish to negotiate include:

     (a)	Pricing of the contract. For example: 

     (i)	lowering the monthly rent for leasing commercial property or equipment;
     (ii)	charging rent on the basis of gross turnover of the tenant/lessee each month over a certain period; and/or
     (iii)	lowering or increasing the price of goods or services delivered.

<a name="q30">**30. My counterparty to the contract is unreasonable. Can the Government intervene and help me with my negotiations with my counterparty?** </a><a href="#a30" title="Return to top">↩</a>
