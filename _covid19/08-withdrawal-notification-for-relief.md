### Withdrawal of Notification for Relief ###

##### Step 1 #####
If the party who has served the <b>Notification for Relief</b> wishes to withdraw the <b>Notification for Relief</b>, they must serve a <b>Notice of Withdrawal</b> on:
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligations in the contract; and
* Issuer of a Related Performance Bond, if applicable.

To serve the <b>Notice of Withdrawal</b> using the electronic system (if you have the email addresses of the above parties):
* For parties who are individuals, please use this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/withdrawal-of-notification-singpass){:target="_blank"}.
* For parties which are business entities, please use this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/withdrawal-of-notification-corppass){:target="_blank"}.

Other modes of service set out in the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts) Regulations 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S303-2020?DocDate=20200420){:target="_blank"}.

##### Step 2 #####
If an **Application for an Assessor’s Determination** has already been submitted to the Registrar, the party must also submit to the Registrar a <b>Declaration of the Service</b> demonstrating that the Notice of Withdrawal has been served on the parties in Step 1, within <b>2 working days</b> of completing Step 1:

* For Applicants which are business entities, please use this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/declaration-of-service-corppass){:target="_blank"}.

##### Step 3 #####
(This **only** applies if a party had previously lodged the Notification for Relief to obtain a stay or dismissal of court or arbitral proceedings, which is covered [here](/covid19-relief/memorandum-of-notification).)

The party who had previously [lodged a copy of the Notification for Relief](/covid19-relief/memorandum-of-notification) with the court or arbitral tribunal must update the court or arbitral tribunal of the withdrawal of the Notification for Relief by submitting a **[Memorandum of Service of Withdrawal of Notification for Relief](/files/covid19-forms/form-5.docx)** within <b>2 working days</b> after completing Step 1.
