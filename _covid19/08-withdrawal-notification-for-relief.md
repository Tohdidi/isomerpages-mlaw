### Withdrawal of Notification for Relief ###

##### Step 1 #####
If the party who has served the <b>Notification for Relief</b> wishes to withdraw the <b>Notification for Relief</b>, they must serve a <b>Notice of Withdrawal</b> on:
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligations in the contract; and
* Issuer of a Related Performance Bond, if applicable.

To serve the <b>Notice of Withdrawal</b> using the electronic system (if you have the email addresses of the above parties):
* For parties who are individuals, please use this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/withdrawal-of-notification-singpass){:target="_blank"}.
