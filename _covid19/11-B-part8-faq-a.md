### FAQs for Situation A – Additional rental expenses for construction goods ###

#### Situation A – Where a person who rented goods used for construction work is or will be liable for additional rental expenses ####

A person who has rented goods for use in construction work may apply for relief if he is or will be liable to his supplier for additional rental expenses due to a delay or breach in a separate construction or supply (or related) contract. For example, a contractor may have rented goods (e.g.scaffolding material, hand drills) from a supplier to perform works under a construction contract that the contractor has with a third party. The contractor may be liable for additional rental expenses incurred as a result of returning the goods later than intended because construction works are delayed due to the COVID-19 situation. The contractor may apply for relief under Part 8 in respect of the additional rental expenses.

Part 8 also applies to the situations below. Further details may be found in the FAQs that are linked below:
