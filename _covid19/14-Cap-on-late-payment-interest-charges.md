### Cap on late payment interest or charges for specific contracts ###

Many contracts contain clauses which impose interest or other charges for late payment. Sometimes, the interest rates or charges stipulated can be high. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a drastic effect across all segments of the economy, and many Singaporeans and local businesses have missed some payments as a result.

To help Singaporeans and businesses who are struggling because of COVID-19 with temporary cash flow relief, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (the “Act”) provided businesses and individuals who are unable to meet certain payment obligations because of COVID-19 a temporary moratorium from enforcement actions during the prescribed period (until 19 October 2020). However, during this time, payments and interest thereon continue to accrue.

Once the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act is brought into force, there will be a cap on late payment interest and charges for arrears that arise due to COVID-19 under prescribed contracts.   

This will help some businesses who are struggling to avoid a crippling debt load, and to make a quicker eventual recovery.

Further details, such as the contracts that will be covered by this measure and the prescribed interest rates, will be announced at a later date.
