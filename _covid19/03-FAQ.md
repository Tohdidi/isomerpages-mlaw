Frequently Asked Questions
1. What does the Bill seek to do? Who benefits?
The Bill aims to provide temporary cash-flow relief to businesses and individuals in specific types of contracts who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations because of COVID-19, by suspending certain actions to enforce those obligations for six months.
This gives these businesses and individuals time to work out a solution with the other party without the threat or uncertainty of litigation or legal proceedings.
It does not mean that obligations are postponed or are absolved. Parties may still be charged interest or penalties if they delay in performance or fail to perform.
