### Frequently Asked Questions ###
**1. What does the Bill seek to do? Who benefits?**

The Bill aims to provide temporary cash-flow relief to businesses and individuals in specific types of contracts who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations because of COVID-19, by suspending certain actions to enforce those obligations for six months.
This gives these businesses and individuals time to work out a solution with the other party without the threat or uncertainty of litigation or legal proceedings.
It does <u>not</u> mean that obligations are postponed or are absolved. Parties may still be charged interest or penalties if they delay in performance or fail to perform.


**2. What types of contracts are covered?**

The Bill covers the following contracts, as long as they were entered into <u>before</u> 25 March 2020.
Leases or licences for commercial and industrial property (e.g. lease for factory
premises)
* Construction contracts or supply contracts (e.g. contract for supply of materials)
* Event contracts: Provision of goods and services for events (e.g. venue or catering for
weddings, business meetings)
* Tourism-related contracts: Provision of goods and services relating to tourism (e.g.
cruises, hotel accommodation bookings)
* Certain secured loan facilities granted by a bank or a finance company to Small &amp;
Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
* Certain hire-purchase agreements (e.g. where the good hired is a commercial vehicle)


**3. What about other types of contracts? Can they be covered by the Bill?**

The Bill aims to provide temporary cash-flow relief to businesses and individuals in specific types of contracts. These are contracts where fulfilment of contractual obligations has been significantly impacted by COVID-19.

The list of contracts can be amended by the Minister for Law after the Bill is passed. The Government will continue to monitor the situation, take in feedback and adjust the list where necessary.


** 4. What relief does the Bill provide?**

The Bill aims to provide temporary relief from legal action for up to six months after the Bill commences for those contracts affected by COVID-19. The Bill applies only to those contractual obligations to be performed on or after 1 February 2020 that cannot be fulfilled because of COVID-19.

When a party to a contract serves a notification for relief on the other party, the following actions will be prohibited:
* Starting or continuing court proceedings or insolvency proceedings
* Enforcing collateral over commercial or industrial property (e.g. commercial premises)
* Enforcing collateral over plant or machinery that is used for business (e.g. delivery vehicle)
* Terminating leases for commercial or industrial property, on the basis of non-payment of rent
* If any court proceedings have already started, they will be stayed or suspended.
