Frequently Asked Questions
**1. What does the Bill seek to do? Who benefits?**

The Bill aims to provide temporary cash-flow relief to businesses and individuals in specific types of contracts who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations because of COVID-19, by suspending certain actions to enforce those obligations for six months.
This gives these businesses and individuals time to work out a solution with the other party without the threat or uncertainty of litigation or legal proceedings.
It does <u>not</u> mean that obligations are postponed or are absolved. Parties may still be charged interest or penalties if they delay in performance or fail to perform.


**2. What types of contracts are covered?**

The Bill covers the following contracts, as long as they were entered into <u>before</u> 25 March 2020.
Leases or licences for commercial and industrial property (e.g. lease for factory
premises)
* Construction contracts or supply contracts (e.g. contract for supply of materials)
* Event contracts: Provision of goods and services for events (e.g. venue or catering for
weddings, business meetings)
* Tourism-related contracts: Provision of goods and services relating to tourism (e.g.
cruises, hotel accommodation bookings)
* Certain secured loan facilities granted by a bank or a finance company to Small &amp;
Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
* Certain hire-purchase agreements (e.g. where the good hired is a commercial vehicle)
