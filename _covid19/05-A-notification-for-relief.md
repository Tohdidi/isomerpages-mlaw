### Notification for Relief ### 

We recommend that both parties first discuss, understand each other’s positions, and try to reach a compromise which parties can do, taking into account the framework set out in the Act as well as the rental relief framework set out in the Amendment Act.

<u>Rental Relief and Additional Rental Relief under the Amendment Act</u> 

Eligible tenant occupiers, seeking rental relief under the Amendment Act, <u>do not</u> have to serve a Notification for Relief on their landlord.  

Under the rental relief framework, eligible Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and specified non-profit organisations (NPOs) can get up to 4 months waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties and up to 2 months waiver of rent for industrial / office properties. 

The Amendment Act also provides for an automatic moratorium on enforcement actions against tenant occupiers for non-payment of rent under the lease or licence agreement. 

Please click [here](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes#eligibility) to find out if you are eligible for the rental relief under the Amendment Act. 

<u>Relief under the Act</u>
If you require relief under the Act for a contract that is covered by Part 2 of the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){:target="_blank"}, you have to serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b>.

The party seeking relief must serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b> on the following Recipients, where applicable:
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligation in the contract; and
* The issuer of a performance bond or equivalent for the performance of the obligation, where the contract is a construction contract or supply contract (“<b>Issuer of Related Performance Bond</b>”).

**Please note that that the service of the Notification for Relief does not constitute a filing with the Registrar.**
