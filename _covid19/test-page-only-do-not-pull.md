**1.	Why has the Government decided to implement this rental relief framework?**

*	The rental relief framework seeks to help affected SMEs, and specified non-profit organisations (“NPOs”) with their cash flow by providing for the fair handling of their accumulated rental obligations, and a fair sharing of economic hardship due to the impact of COVID-19 among the Government, landlords and tenants. 

*	The Government does not ordinarily intervene in private contracts. However, due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on SMEs, the Government has decided to take targeted and temporary measures to intervene to safeguard the economic structure for the common good. The rental relief measures are necessary to support SMEs and the broader economy, which will in turn help property owners continue to enjoy the stable value of their assets in the longer term. 

*	The framework also applies to specified NPOs that are similarly affected by the economic impact of COVID-19. These are NPOs operating with a clear public benefit to the community, businesses, and society at large. 


**2.	How many months of rental relief can an eligible SME or NPO tenant (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) obtain?**

*	Eligible SMEs and NPOs which are tenant-occupiers who operate their business in a rented property (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) can receive up to 4 months’ waiver of rent* for qualifying commercial properties (e.g. shops), and up to 2 months’ waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties), comprising the following:

    a)	<u>Rental Relief for eligible SME and NPO tenants (supported by Government assistance)</u>: Eligible tenant-occupiers in qualifying commercial properties and other non-residential properties will receive the rental relief through a waiver of rent from their landlords. Property owners will receive support through the: (a) [Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 announced in the Unity and Resilience Budgets](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Working-out-your-taxes/Property-Tax-Reliefs/#title1); and (b) [Government cash grant announced in the Fortitude Budget](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Property/Government-cash-grant--announced-in-Fortitude-Budget-/). 
    
    Eligible SMEs and NPOs in qualifying commercial properties will receive up to 2 months’ waiver of their rent, and eligible SMEs and NPOs in other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties) will receive up to 1 months’ waiver of their rent. 
    
    b)	<u>Additional Rental Relief for SME and NPO tenants (supported by landlords/ property owners)</u>: Eligible SME and NPO tenant-occupiers who have seen a 35% or more drop in their average monthly gross income due to COVID-19 will receive up to an additional 2 months’ waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties, and up to an additional 1 month’s waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties). 

    For more details on the definitions of property in each category, please refer to [this](/files/rentalreliefframework/categorisation_of_properties.pdf).
    
    *The value of the rent to be waived is based on the contractual rent of the tenant, excluding any maintenance fee and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security.

**3.	What period does the rental relief cover?**

*	Generally, the Rental Relief covers the first 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and the first month within the period of April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties).

*	For eligible tenant-occupiers which meet the criteria for the Additional Rental Relief, the Additional Rental Relief covers a further 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and a further 1 month within the period of  April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties.

*	In cases where rent has already been paid for the relevant relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.

Note: The rental waivers in the table are applicable in cases where the tenant-occupier occupies the property throughout the relief period. Please refer to the section <a href="#scenario">"Specific scenarios"</a> for details of the application of the rental waivers in cases where the tenant-occupier does not occupy the property throughout the relief period.


**4.	What are the eligibility criteria for an SME/NPO tenant to qualify for the rental relief?**

*	The rental relief framework, comprising the Rental Relief and the Additional Rental Relief, applies to eligible tenant-occupiers of prescribed properties in qualifying leases or licences that are in writing, or evidenced in writing, which are:
 
    a)	(i) Entered into before 25 March 2020; or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and renewed either automatically or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract; and 
    
    b)	In force at any time between 1 April and 31 July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and between 1 April and 31 May 2020 for other non-residential (e.g. industrial/office) properties.

<u>Additional Rental Relief</u>

*	The Additional Rental Relief will apply to tenant-occupiers who qualify for Rental Relief, have carried on business at the rented property before 25 March 2020 and meet the following additional criteria:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
 <li><u>For SMEs</u></li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>(Note: this additional criterion is not applicable if the tenant-occupier is a stand-alone company that is not part of any group of companies) Where 50% or more of the total voting shares or power in the tenant-occupier is held by a Singapore-incorporated entity (i.e. it is a subsidiary of another entity incorporated in Singapore) and the tenant-occupier is a member of a Singapore group of entities<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> ("group") during the period 1 April to 31 May 2020, the group's aggregate revenue is not more than S$100 million for the Financial Year 2018 or a later appropriate period where applicable<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>; and</li>
<li>The tenant-occupier suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly gross income at the outlet level for the period 1 April to 31 May 2020, compared to 1 April to 31 May 2019, or alternative periods if the tenant-occupier was not operational as of 1 Apr 2019<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
 <li><u>For NPOs</u>: The tenant-occupier suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly gross income at the entity level for the period 1 April to 31 May 2020, compared to 1 April to 31 May 2019, or alternative periods if the tenant-occupier was not operational as of 1 Apr 2019<sup>4</sup>. </li>
</ol>

<p><sup id="fn2">2. A Singapore group of entities means a group of entities that are incorporated or established in Singapore and which are related through ownership or control in such a way that the group is either required to prepare consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes under FRS 110 or an equivalent standard or would have been so required if equity interests in any of the entities were traded on any stock exchange in Singapore. <a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn3">3. Where none or only one member of the Singapore group of entities has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of the group’s financial year ending on a date in the year 2018, and more than one member of the same group has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of the group’s financial year ending on a date in the year 2019, the reference period will be FY2019 instead. If the foregoing is inapplicable, if more than one member of the Singapore group of entities has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of the group’s financial year ending in the year 2020 on a date that is on or before 31 March 2020, the reference period will be FY 2020. For any other case, the aggregate average monthly revenue of all members of the group will be extrapolated for comparison against the $100 million revenue threshold. Please refer to Regulation 14 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020 for further details. <a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn4">4. If the tenant-occupier commenced business after 1 April 2019, comparison will be against the period from the date of commencement of business to 24 March 2020 (both dates inclusive) to ascertain the decrease of 35% or more. <a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>

* Please refer to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdL_HNRBuc85S5vGyYu2SAHDKNLCgVNfiatAK2FtrfFKOSf_g/viewform" target="new">online self-assessment tool </a> for a preliminary assessment on the rental waiver that a tenant may be eligible for or that a landlord may be required to provide. 

**5.	What is the definition of “gross income” in the context of the criteria for Additional Rental Relief?**

* Gross income, in the context of the eligibility criteria for the Additional Rental Relief under Regulation 14 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020, means total revenue minus direct costs (but before indirect costs like overheads and taxes).
 
* In computing gross income, all income derived by the company/NPO, including trade income and separate sources of income, should be taken into account. This would include Government grants, if any.


**6. Will tenants/ sub-tenants of Government landlords enjoy the same rental waivers?** 

*	The rental relief framework generally applies to tenants/ sub-tenants of Government landlords. 

*	The Government provides rental waivers to cover both the Government’s and landlord’s share of rental relief.  Rental waivers announced for tenants in government properties is 4 months in total for commercial tenants, and 2 months in total for other non-residential tenants (based on eligible uses), in line with the requirements under the legislation. Sub-tenants renting government properties will be granted rental waivers from the master tenants. 

*	Respective tenants would have received the letter on the rental waiver issued by their Government Landlords. You may wish to approach your Government landlord directly if you require assistance.


**7.	Will intermediary landlords also receive rental waivers if their tenant is an eligible tenant-occupier? What if they do not meet the eligibility criteria for rental relief?**

*	If the eligible tenant-occupier rents the property through an intermediary landlord, all intermediary landlords along the chain will also receive rental waivers in respect of that eligible tenant-occupier for the corresponding period from their immediate landlords, regardless of whether the intermediary landlords meet the eligibility criteria. An intermediary landlord’s entitlement to rental waivers is solely dependent on the tenant-occupier’s eligibility.


**8.	What happens if the rent which an intermediary landlord collects from his tenant is higher than the rent he pays to his landlord? Will he be required to absorb the difference in granting the rental waivers?**

*	An intermediary landlord will be required to provide a full waiver to their tenant according to the applicable rental relief period.


**9.	What if a company is newly incorporated and does not have financial statements for the financial year 2018 or 2019?**

*	In such a case, and depending on when the tenant-occupier commenced business, the tenant-occupier should provide its unaudited balance-sheet, profit and loss statement and cash flow statement from the date of commencement of the business (at the prescribed property or any other place), supported by a statutory declaration by the tenant or (if the tenant is an entity) a relevant officer of the tenant. Where such documents are unavailable, a tenant can also provide a statutory declaration of its revenue.  Please see Regulation 4 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations read with Part 1 of the Seventh Schedule for further details. 

*	A statutory declaration made in Singapore must be in the form set out in the First Schedule of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap. 211) and be made before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Justice of the Peace. Please refer to the following <a href="http://conp.sg/co-np-directory-listing">link</a> for a directory of Commissioner for Oaths in Singapore and the following <a href="https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/ministries/pmo/departments/jp">link</a> for a directory of Justices of the Peace in Singapore.


**10. Why has the period of April to May 2020 been chosen as the period for determining the 35% drop in gross income – is it possible to choose a different period for comparison? Why is it necessary to compare gross income against the same period year on year? What if a tenant was not operational during the April to May 2019 period – how will the drop in revenue be assessed?**

*	The reason why April to May 2020 is used for the period of comparison is that it corresponds to the period of the Circuit Breaker, and the Additional Rental Relief to be provided by landlords to tenants is intended to provide more help to SME tenants which have been substantially hit by COVID-19. The reason why the same period of time for a year on year comparison is used is to account for seasonal fluctuations in revenue. 

*	Where businesses started operations after 1 Apr 2019 but before 25 Mar 2020, average monthly gross revenue derived from the date the business commenced operations to 24 Mar 2020 is to be compared with the average monthly gross income derived between 1 Apr 2020 and 31 May 2020 to establish a 35% or more drop at the outlet.

* Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that the rental relief framework is intended to establish a baseline position for the handling of tenants’ rental obligations. Landlords and tenants are free to work out mutually agreeable arrangements that best address their specific circumstances.
