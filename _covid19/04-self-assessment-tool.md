### Self-Assessment Tool ###

We recommend that both parties first discuss, understand each otherâ€™s positions, and try to reach a compromise which parties can do, taking into account the framework set out in the Act.

If you would like a preliminary assessment as to whether your case qualifies for relief under the Act, you can use the [online self-assessment tool](https://go.gov.sg/covid19-assessment-tool){:target="_blank"} developed in collaboration with the State Courts and Temasek Polytechnic.
