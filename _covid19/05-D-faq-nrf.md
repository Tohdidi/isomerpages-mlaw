### Notification for Relief ###
<u>I am the party seeking relief and sender of the Notification for Reliefâ€¦</u>

**1. Must a Notification for Relief take a certain form?**  

*	Yes, there is a prescribed form for the Notification for Relief. Please refer to the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass) (if you are serving the Notification for yourself) or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass) (if you are serving the Notification on behalf of your business or company). 
*	If you do not serve the Notification for Relief in the prescribed form, it is invalid for the purposes of the Act.

**2. There are multiple parties to my contract. Do I need to fill up multiple Notifications of Relief to serve on each of the parties?** 

*	No. Only one Notification for Relief should be filled up. In Part B of the form, you should indicate the particulars of all the parties to the contract. A copy of the same Notification for Relief should be served on each of the parties.
