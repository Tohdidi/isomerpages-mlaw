### Key Steps in the Part 8 Proceedings ### 

*Before applying for relief under Part 8 of the Act*

We strongly encourage all individuals and businesses to discuss any differences amicably between themselves and make best efforts to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution. You should only make an application for relief (“**Application**”) under Part 8 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (the “**Act**”) if you are unable to come to an amicable settlement with the other party or parties to the affected contract.

*Important note*

Please note that there cannot be concurrent proceedings in any other dispute resolution fora, which relate to the subject of your Application. Therefore, a Part 8 Application must be made **before** the following: 

* The commencement of court or arbitral proceedings in relation to the subject of the Part 8 Application.

* The making of an adjudication application under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (“**SOPA**”) in relation to the subject of the Part 8 Application.  

* The end of 2 months after the end of the prescribed period (i.e., before 31 May 2021).

The Registrar will **reject** any Application made after the commencement of court or arbitral proceedings, or after the making of an adjudication application under SOPA.
*Frequently asked questions*

Relief under Part 8 of the Act is applicable in the following thee situations. Further details are set out in the FAQs linked below: 
* Situation A – Where a person who rented construction goods is or will be liable for additional rental expenses
* Situation B – Where a lessee or licensee (i.e., a tenant) of non-residential immovable property is unable to carry out renovation or fitting out works during the rent-free period
* Situation C – Where a lessor or licensor (i.e., a landlord) of non-residential immovable property is unable to deliver possession in accordance with the original date under the lease or licence 

Please note that the Assessor’s determination of the Part 8 Application (“**Part 8 Determination**”) is final and binding. There is no appeal from the Part 8 Determination.

##### Step 1: Applicant applies for relief under Part 8 of the Act  #####

Any person who wishes to apply for relief under Part 8 (the “**Applicant(s) **” ) must submit an **Application** to the Registrar that is accompanied by:
* a copy of the affected contract; or 
* if there is no written contract, a description of how the affected contract was made and the relevant terms of the affected contract; and
* all supporting documents which the Applicant wishes the Assessor to consider.  (If the Applicant fails to submit sufficient supporting material, the Assessor may not be satisfied that relief should be granted.)

An **Application** can be submitted at no cost.

To submit the **Application** to the Registrar using the electronic system:

* Please use this link (CorpPass) if you are applying on behalf of a business entity. 

* Please use this link (SingPass) if you are applying for relief in your own capacity. 

**Note**:
* It is important that you use the **correct link** to submit the Application. Otherwise, the Application may be rejected. 

* In some instances, you may not be able to use CorpPass on behalf of a business, e.g. if the landlord is a REIT.  In such instances, you may use the CorpPass or the SingPass of your duly authorized representative (e.g. the CorpPass of the duly authorised property manager of a REIT).

* By submitting an Application, you agree:

  * To keep any information or documents disclosed by the other party or parties for the purposes of the Application, or any matters discussed during the proceedings before the Assessor, **confidential**, and **will not disclose any such information, documents or matters to any third parties**. 
  * That the Registry may, collect, use, or disclose, any information or document that has been submitted with the Application including but not limited to any information under Part A of the Application. Such information or document may be disclosed to another public agency or third party (including officers, contractors, and agents thereof) insofar as it is required for the administration of the relief under Part 8 of the Act, or ascertaining compliance with any law, regulation, or guideline.
