### Rental Relief Framework ###

#### Rental relief provided by Government and Landlords ####

**a.	How many months of rental relief can an eligible SME tenant (including subtenants and licensees) obtain?**

* Eligible SMEs which are occupying tenants (including subtenants and licensees) can receive a total of 4 months’ waiver of base rental for qualifying commercial properties, and a total of 2 months’ waiver of base rental for industrial and office properties, comprising the following:

    a)	<u>Government assistance</u>: The Government will provide property owners of qualifying commercial properties and industrial/office properties: (a) Property Tax Rebate announced in the Resilience and Unity Budgets and (b) Government cash grant announced in the Fortitude Budget. 
   
    To ensure that these measures benefit the intended beneficiaries, the Act will mandate that eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties receive 2 months’ waiver of their base rental, and eligible SMEs in industrial/office properties receive 1 month’s waiver of their base rental. This will provide rental relief to eligible SMEs (i.e. with not more than $100 million in annual turnover) with qualifying leases or licences in force on 1 April 2020 and (i) entered into before 25 March 2020; or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and renewed automatically, or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract. 

    b)	<u>Additional rental relief to be provided by landlords</u>: Eligible SMEs who have seen a significant drop in their average monthly revenue due to COVID-19 will receive an additional 2 months’ waiver of base rental for qualifying commercial properties, and an additional 1 month’s waiver of base rental for industrial and office properties. The Act will mandate that landlords provide this additional rental relief to eligible tenants automatically, by way of rental waivers.


**b.	What period does the rental relief cover?**

*	The rental waiver through the Government assistance will apply to the rental for the months of April and May 2020 for eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties, and April 2020 for eligible SMEs in industrial/office properties, as long as their leases or licences are in force on 1 April 2020 <u>and</u> (i) entered into before 25 March 2020 or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and was renewed automatically, or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract. This period of rental waiver corresponds to the start of the Circuit Breaker when businesses were clearly impacted by COVID-19.


*	The additional rental waiver provided by landlords to tenants substantially impacted by COVID-19 will apply for the months of June and July 2020 for eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties, and May 2020 for eligible SMEs in industrial/office properties, as long as their leases or licences are in force on 1 April 2020 and were (i) entered into before 25 March 2020 or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and were renewed automatically, or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract.


*	In cases where rent has already been paid for the relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.


**c.	What are the eligibility criteria for an SME tenant to qualify for the additional rental relief from their landlords?**

* Occupying tenants (including subtenants and licensees) will need to satisfy all criteria below to be eligible for the mandatory rental relief co-shared by landlords:
    
    a)	SME at the group level (≤$100 million turnover in 2019);
    b)  Substantial drop in average monthly revenue during COVID-19 (average monthly revenue from April to May 2020 on an outlet level reduced by 35% or more, compared to April to May 2019) 
    c)  The tenancy must be in force on 1 April 2020 and must have been: (i) entered into before 25 March 2020; or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and was renewed automatically, or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract. 


**d.	What should I do prior to the implementation of the Act?** 

*	The rental waiver through the Government assistance will apply to April and May 2020 for eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties, and April 2020 for eligible SMEs/ in industrial/office properties.


*	The additional rental waiver provided by landlords to tenants will apply to June and July 2020 for SMEs in qualifying commercial properties, and May 2020 for SMEs in industrial/office properties.


*	Eligible SME tenants (including qualifying sub-tenants and licensees) need not pay the rent for these months. In cases where rent has already been paid for the relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.


*	For the landlords, their obligations will be triggered once IRAS issues the notice of the cash grant or nominal notice to eligible property owners, from end-July 2020 onwards. To ensure that the benefit of the cash grant reaches its intended beneficiaries, agencies will need more time to work out the details and process. IRAS will provide more details of the cash grant on its website, once the details are worked out.


*	In the meantime, the Act will provide for a moratorium on enforcement action for non-payment of rent by SME tenants, in the time between the Act coming into force, and the triggering of the landlords’ obligations. Before the Act comes into force, qualifying businesses and individuals who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations because of COVID-19 can serve a Notification for Relief under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. 


**e.	What if I cannot afford to pay my rent? Will my landlord be able to evict me in the intervening period, before my eligibility for the rental waiver as an SME tenant is confirmed?**

*	The Act will provide for a moratorium on enforcement action for non-payment of rent, in the time between the Act coming into force, and the triggering of the landlords’ obligations.  This does not apply to a tenant which is not an SME. Before the Act comes into force, qualifying businesses and individuals who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations because of COVID-19 can serve a Notification for Relief under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. 


#### Landlord’s application for assessment ####


**f.	What can a landlord do if he is not satisfied that his tenant is eligible for the additional rental relief?**

*	Landlords will have the opportunity to apply to have an Assessor determine whether the tenant satisfies the eligibility criteria to receive the additional rental waiver. 


*	The legislation will require that tenants provide the necessary information to determine eligibility to the landlord upon request. 


*	The Assessor’s determination will be binding on both parties.


**g.	What can a landlord do if he is unable to afford a rental waiver?**

*	Landlords who are unable to afford to give the mandated rental waiver may seek an assessment by the Assessor on the grounds of financial hardship.


*	The Assessor will take into consideration the rental the landlord receives (based on the annual value of his properties) and the proportion of the landlord’s dependence on the rental income for his livelihood. 


*	If the landlord meets the grounds of financial hardship, the Assessor can halve the amount of additional rental relief that needs to be provided by the landlord. The Assessor’s determination will be binding on both parties.


**h.	What is the process and criteria for assessment?**

*	More information on the application process and assessment criteria will be shared in due course.
