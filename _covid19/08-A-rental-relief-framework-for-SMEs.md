---
### Introduction ###

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act (“Act”) that was passed in Parliament on 5 June 2020 provides a rental relief framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The rental relief framework aims to help affected SMEs* who need more time and support to recover from the impact of COVID-19, by providing mandated co-sharing of rental obligations between the Government, landlords and tenants.

These measures are intended to establish a baseline position for the handling of tenants’ rental obligations. Landlords and tenants are encouraged to continue to try and work out mutually agreeable arrangements that best address their specific circumstances.

The new rental relief provisions under Part 2A of the Act will come into force by end-July 2020. Do note that the information provided on the Ministry of Law’s website is subject to the finalisation of the regulations.

##### <a name="rental">Overview of Rental Relief Framework</a><a href="#ref1" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

Eligible SMEs which are tenant-occupiers who operate their business in a rented property (including sub-tenants and licensees) can receive 4 months’ waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties (e.g. shops), and 2 months’ waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties).

The rental relief will be part supported by Government assistance, and part shared by landlords, as summarised in the table below:

</div>

** Owners of qualifying commercial properties (e.g. shops) will generally receive approximately 1.2 months of rent through the Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020, and owners of other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial/ office properties) will generally receive approximately 0.36 month through the Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020. The Government will provide additional cash grants approximately equivalent to 0.8 month of rent to owners of qualifying commercial properties, and approximately 0.64 month of rent to owners of other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial/office properties). To ensure that these measures benefit the intended beneficiaries, landlords are required to grant eligible SMEs in qualifying commercial properties 2 months’ waiver of their rent, and eligible SMEs in other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial/office properties) 1 month’s waiver of their rent. For more details on the Property Tax Rebate and the Government cash grant, please refer to [IRAS’ website](
https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Property/Government-cash-grant--announced-in-Fortitude-Budget-/). 

The value of the rent to be waived is based on the contractual rent of the tenant, excluding any maintenance fees and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security.

The rental waivers may be offset by:

a)  Any monetary payments or reduction of rent or licence fee provided for, or previously agreed to, by the landlord to the tenant-occupier from February 2020 onwards; and/or

b)  Any Property Tax Rebate that has been passed on by the property owner in respect of the property. 

##### <a name="eligibility">Eligibility Criteria for Rental Relief</a><a href="#ref2" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

The Rental Relief will apply to tenant-occupiers who are SMEs with ≤$100 million in annual revenue in the Financial Year ending 2018, based on Year of Assessment 2019 corporate or individual income tax returns, at the entity level.

The Additional Rental Relief will apply to those tenant-occupiers who:

a)  Have suffered ≥ 35% drop in average monthly revenue on an outlet level from April to May 2020, compared to April to May 2019; and
    
b)  Are SMEs at the group level (≤$100 million turnover based on the latest available accounts).

The rental relief framework applies to qualifying leases or licences which are:

a)  (i) Entered into before 25 March 2020 or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and renewed either automatically or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract; and 

b)  In force any time between 1 April to 31 July 2020 for qualifying commercial leases or licenses; and 1 April to 31 May 2020 for other non-residential (e.g. industrial/office) leases or licenses.

##### <a name="effected">How the Rental Waivers will be Effected</a><a href="#ref3" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

From end-July 2020, IRAS will issue a notice of cash grant and disburse the Government cash grant to qualifying property owners. Property owners are required to serve a copy of the notice to their tenants, or their master tenants. Master tenants who receive a copy of the notice are required to serve a copy of the notice to their sub-tenants. Once the notice of cash grant is received, the rental is treated as waived under the Act. Eligible tenants do not need to do anything to qualify for the rental waiver.

Eligible tenants do not need to pay rent for the period covered by the rental relief framework. If rent has already been paid, tenants can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, get a refund from their landlords.

Where necessary, tenants may be required to share relevant information with their landlords to prove their eligibility. This may include signed/declared management accounts for the relevant months, or if these are not available, a statutory declaration from the tenant.

Tenants who do not qualify for relief and who do not pay rent will be subject to the consequences spelt out in the contract, including paying the rent accrued, and any applicable interest and charges. 

Tenants who are unable to pay their rent due to COVID-19 and require protection from legal or enforcement proceedings by their landlords may serve a Notification for Relief (“NFR”) under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act using the form accessible at this [link](https://www.go.gov.sg/nfr). After the NFR is served, the landlord may not evict the tenant or terminate the lease for the prescribed period (up until 19 October 2020).

##### <a name="assess">Landlord’s Application for Assessment<a href="#ref4" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

<u>On whether the tenant meets the eligibility criteria and qualifies for the rental waiver</u>

Landlords will have the opportunity to apply to have an Assessor determine whether the tenant satisfies the eligibility criteria. The case will be examined by an Assessor,
who will ascertain the tenant’s (or sub-tenant’s/licensee’s) eligibility to receive the rental waiver. The legislation will require that tenants provide the necessary information to the landlord upon request.

<u>To request to halve the additional rental relief as the landlord is facing financial hardship</u>

The landlord may also seek an assessment on the grounds of financial hardship if they feel they are unable to provide the additional rental waiver. The Assessor will take into consideration the Annual Value of the landlord’s properties and the proportion of the landlord’s dependence on the rental income for his livelihood.

If the landlord meets the grounds of financial hardship, the Assessor can halve the amount of additional rental relief, i.e. 1 month waiver of rental for qualifying commercial properties, and half a month waiver of rental for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties).

The Assessor’s determination will be binding on both the landlord and the tenant.

##### <a name="repay">Repayment Scheme for Rental Arrears<a href="#ref5" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

Eligible SMEs that qualify for the additional relief by landlords may also elect to serve notice on their landlords to take up a prescribed repayment scheme for a specified portion of rental arrears accumulated from 1 February up till 19 October 2020 (corresponding to the prescribed period of relief for non-performance of contractual obligations provided for under the Act). The notice should be served no later than 19 October 2020.

Upon serving the notice, tenants must start payment of the first instalment **no later than 1 November 2020**. Under the repayment scheme, tenants can pay for a specified portion of their arrears over an extended period of time (up to 9 months, or the remaining term of the tenancy, whichever is shorter) in equal instalments, with the interest payable on such arrears capped at 3% per annum.

For commercial properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments will be 5 months’ rent. For industrial/office properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments will be 4 months’ rent.

If the tenant fails to make a payment under the statutory repayment scheme within a prescribed period of time, or the tenant terminates the lease or licence, or the landlord terminates the lease agreement for any other default by the tenant, the statutory repayment scheme will be cancelled, and the landlord will be entitled to:

-   Immediate payment of all the arrears

-   Take steps under the contract for rentals not paid.
 
Landlords may also draw the existing security deposits to offset accumulated rental arrears during the repayment period. They may do so, until there is the equivalent of one month of rent remaining in the security deposit. At the end of the repayment period, the tenant will be obliged to reinstate the security deposit to the contractual amount.

Tenants who have rescheduled the payment of arrears will have to provide specified documents and information to their landlords if: (a) the lease agreement is terminated or repudiated during the repayment period; and (b) there are 2 or more rescheduled repayment instalments outstanding.

The documents and information to be provided will include filing a statutory declaration on their statement of accounts from April 2020 until the termination or repudiation of the lease. The tenant will also be required to set out how he proposes to repay the outstanding rental arrears.
