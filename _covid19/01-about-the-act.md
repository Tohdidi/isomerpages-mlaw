### About the Act ###

> “You’re looking at economic devastation. Businesses destroyed, people’s lives ruined, and in such a situation, you don’t talk contract. You talk equity, you talk justice, you talk about what is the right thing to do.” - Minister for Law K Shanmugam SC, Interview with CNBC, 7 April 2020
