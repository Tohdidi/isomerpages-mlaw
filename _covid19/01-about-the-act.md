### About the Act ###

> “You’re looking at economic devastation. Businesses destroyed, people’s lives ruined, and in such a situation, you don’t talk contract. You talk equity, you talk justice, you talk about what is the right thing to do.” - Minister for Law K Shanmugam SC, Interview with CNBC, 7 April 2020
 
#### COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 ####

The [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (“the Act”)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){:target="_blank"} seeks to offer temporary relief to businesses and individuals who are unable to perform their contractual obligations due <u>on or after</u> 1 February 2020 because of COVID-19.
 
The Act covers relevant contractual obligations that are to be performed <u>on or after</u> 1 February 2020, for contracts that were entered into <u>before</u> 25 March 2020.
 
#### COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill 2020 ####

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill (the “Amendment Bill”) was passed in Parliament on 5 June 2020. The Amendment Bill seeks to provide a rental relief framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and to enhance the relief available for businesses, organisations and individuals, who are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations because of COVID-19. It also introduces a cap on late payment interest or charges for specific contracts, and provides relief for certain parties affected by breaches or delays in construction or supply contracts (defined [here](/covid19-relief/faq/lease-licence)), where such breach or delay is due to COVID-19.

For more information about the Acts, please see [this page](/covid19-relief/types-of-contract) on the types of contracts covered, [this page](/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-SMEs) for the rental relief framework for SMEs and [this page](/covid19-relief/resources) for the press releases and the Second Reading speech by the Minister for Law.
