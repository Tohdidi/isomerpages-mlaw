### Construction contracts or supply contracts, or any performance bond granted thereto ###

#### General FAQs ####
**a. What types of construction or supply contracts are covered by the Act?**

* Construction and supply contracts within the meaning of section 2 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap. 30B) are covered.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Act covers contracts which are excluded from the application of the BSCISOPA pursuant to section 4 of the BCISOPA (e.g. renovation contracts for private residential property), except contracts to the extent that a party carries out construction work or supply goods or services as an employee (within the meaning of the Employment Act (Cap. 91)).


**b. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the contractor or supplier?**

* If you are unable to perform your obligations due to COVID-19, the other party to the contract cannot commence or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings against you during the prescribed period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020). 

* In addition, if you are unable to supply goods or services due to Covid-19, the Act gives you a defence against any claims for breach of contract or damages (e.g. liquidated damages) if the breach arose due to your inability to perform the obligation, if the inability was materially caused by COVID-19. This defence is available after you have served your Notification for Relief, and may be raised by you in any adjudication or other legal proceedings in which the other party makes such claims against you.

* For the avoidance of doubt, this defence should be raised in any adjudication or other legal proceedings that may be commenced by the other party in respect of the breach of contract.  This defence is not determined by the Assessors under the Act.  In respect of construction contracts or supply contracts, the Assessors will not determine disputes in relation to the contract breach, but will only make a determination where there is a disagreement over the Notification for Relief.  The assessors will only determine whether (a) whether the party to the construction or supply contract is unable to perform an obligation; and (b) whether the inability is to a material extent caused by COVID-19. 

* Calling of a performance bond in relation to your inability to perform your obligations due to COVID-19 earlier than 7 days before its date of expiry will also not be allowed. You can apply to the issuer to extend the term of the performance bond. 

* For more details, please refer to the Ministry of Law and Building and Construction Authority’s joint statement on 20 April 2020, and the FAQs on BCA’s website.

**c. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?**

* The reliefs under the Act **do not take effect automatically.**

* If you qualify for the relief, you need to first **serve a Notification for Relief** on the other party to the contract, using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass){:target="_blank"} or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass){:target="_blank"}. 

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the other party to the contract, the reliefs in (b) will apply.
