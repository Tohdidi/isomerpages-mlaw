### 1. Hire-purchase agreements ###

#### General FAQs ####

* The Act covers hire-purchase agreements and conditional sales agreements of: 

  * A plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for manufacturing, production, or other business purposes; or 

  * A commercial vehicle. 

* The Act does not cover vehicle rental agreements.

  * A goods vehicle (e.g. a truck used to transport goods);
  * An excursion bus, private bus, private-hire bus, omnibus or school bus;
  * A private hire car;
  * A taxi; or
  * An engineering plant (e.g. a tractor, road roller, excavator, forklift)

c. What is a hire-purchase agreement? What is a conditional sales agreement? 

* Both hire-purchase agreements and conditional sales agreements generally include terms under which: 

  * A (the hirer) enjoys the use of goods (e.g., a commercial vehicle) owned by B (the owner), in return for A’s payment of instalments to B
  * If A complies with the terms of the agreement, A will be able to own the goods (e.g., A finishes paying all the instalment sums under the agreement, A exercises an option to purchase)

d. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the hirer/debtor? 

* If you are unable to pay instalments on the hire-purchase agreement due to COVID-19, the finance/leasing company cannot take the following actions against you for 6 months (i.e. up to 19 October 2020): 

  * Repossess the plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for business, or repossess your commercial vehicle
  * Start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings

e. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?

#### Specific FAQs ####
f. I am a private-hire driver and purchased my car through a hire-purchase agreement. I am unable to afford my monthly instalments due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me?

* Yes, the Act applies to hire-purchase agreements where the good hired or conditionally sold under the agreement is a commercial vehicle. This includes private-hire cars.

g. I am taxi driver or a private-hire driver who rented my car or taxi from a car rental company. I am unable to afford my monthly rent due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me? 

* No, the Act does not apply to vehicle rental agreements. 

* However, you may be eligible for the Ministry of Transport’s Point-to-Point Support Package (PPSP) for private-hire drivers. Please refer to <insert website> for details.

h. Does the Act apply to me if I use my vehicle partly for commercial purposes and partly for personal use? 

* It depends on whether your vehicle is a commercial vehicle. Please refer to paragraph (b).
* A personal vehicle registered to provide private hire car services is considered a commercial vehicle for the purposes of the Act.
* A personal vehicle used for travel to and from a place of work will not be considered a commercial vehicle for the purposes of the Act.

i. My finance company repossessed my commercial vehicle before the Act commenced. Does the Act apply to me? 

* Part 2 of the Act on Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts commenced on [20 April 2020]. It does not apply to repossessions that occurred before that date. 

* If you believe that the finance company breached the terms of your hire-purchase agreement, please seek legal advice.  

j. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid instalments (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period? 

* Yes.  The unpaid instalments (and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment if provided for under the contract) continues to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. 

* The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, but merely seeks to suspend the finance company’s right to enforce the contract during the relief period. This gives you some breathing space without the threat of repossession or litigation to sort out your finances, and time for you and the finance company to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable solution.
