#### Specific FAQs ####

Types of agreements and vehicles which the Act applies to

**e. I am a private-hire driver and purchased my car through a hire-purchase agreement. I am unable to afford my monthly instalments due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Yes, the Act applies to hire-purchase agreements where the good hired or conditionally sold under the agreement is a commercial vehicle. This includes chauffeur-driven private-hire cars (with blue decals).

**f. Does the Act apply to me if I use my vehicle partly for commercial purposes and partly for personal use?**

* It depends on whether your vehicle is a commercial vehicle. Please refer to paragraph (b).

* A car registered as a chauffeur-driven private hire car (with blue decals) would be considered a commercial vehicle. 

* A personal vehicle used for travel to and from a place of work is not a commercial vehicle.

**g. I am taxi driver or a private-hire driver who rented my car or taxi from a car rental company. I am unable to afford my monthly rent due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me?**

* No, the Act does not apply to vehicle rental agreements. 

* However, you may be eligible for the Ministry of Transport’s Point-to-Point Support Package (PPSP) for private-hire drivers. Please refer to [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/LTA's%20Measures%20for%20COVID-19/point_to_point_support_package.html){:target="_blank"} for details.

Eligibility and scope of the relief

**h. My business suffered a drop of revenue due to COVID-19. Under the Act, must I still continue paying the instalments?** 

* The instalment continues to be payable. However, the Act prevents the financing company from repossessing the plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for business or commercial vehicle, or commencing or continuing legal action during the prescribed period (i.e. up to 19 October 2020). This gives the hirer and the financing company time to negotiate a mutually acceptable way to deal with the arrears.

* The relief applies only to hirers who can demonstrate that they are unable to pay the instalments due to COVID-19. It does not allow hirers who are able to pay to avoid paying. Hirers who have the ability to pay (even if they suffered a drop in revenue) must continue to pay the instalment.

**i. I was unable to pay the instalment that fell due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to arrears from before 1 February 2020?** 

* No, the Act applies only to the inability to pay the instalments due to COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 onwards. The financing company is entitled to enforce any contractual rights they have for unpaid instalments due before 1 February 2020.

**j. I am unable to pay the instalment due to COVID-19. Should I issue a Notification for Relief or apply for an Assessor’s determination under the Act?**

* If you have been affected by COVID-19, and are unable to perform your contractual obligations, we would encourage you to work together with your financing company to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 

* For both parties, a settlement is preferable to being mired in costly and lengthy legal proceedings.

* If you cannot reach an agreement yet and require protection from legal proceedings, you may serve a Notification for Relief on your financing company, who is then prohibited from taking any of the actions in (c). This will give you temporary protection up to 19 October 2020.

* For the avoidance of doubt, the instalment continues to accrue in the interim.  You are therefore encouraged to use the temporary relief period to work out a solution. 

* In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to pay the instalment, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on [link](/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.

**k. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid instalments (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period?**

* Yes.  The unpaid instalments (and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment, if provided for under the contract) continues to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. 

* The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, but seeks to temporarily prohibit the financing company from enforcing the contract during the relief period.

* While this gives the hirer  some breathing space without the threat of repossession or litigation to sort out his finances, he may be subject to a higher outstanding amount at the end of the temporary relief period as the interest or fees for late payment continues to accrue under his contract with the financing company. 

* As such, hirers are encouraged to engage their financing companies to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution. 

**l. My financing company repossessed my commercial vehicle before the Act commenced. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Part 2 of the Act on Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts commenced on 20 April 2020. It does not apply to repossessions that occurred before that date. 

* If you believe that the financing company breached the terms of your hire-purchase agreement, please seek legal advice.
