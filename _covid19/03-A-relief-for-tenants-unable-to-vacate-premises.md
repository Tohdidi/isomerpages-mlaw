### Relief for tenants unable to vacate business premises ###

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act (the “**Amendment Act**”) that was passed in Parliament on 5 June 2020 introduced section 7B of the Act, which is intended to assist tenants who, because of COVID-19, are unable to vacate their business premises after the lease or licence comes to an end.

Under existing law, these tenants may incur significant liabilities (such as double rent) for "holding over" the premises, even though their failure to vacate arose through no fault of their own. 

Section 7B therefore provides that such tenants who qualify for relief will not have to pay double rent, but a lower rate that is prescribed in the subsidiary legislation. The rates are set out at <a href="#q1">FAQ (1)</a>. The tenant must first serve a Notification for Relief under the Act apart from meeting other conditions. Please see <a href="#q2">FAQ (2)</a> for the qualifying conditions.

To ensure that that landlords are treated fairly and are not out-of-pocket for service, maintenance, and utilities charges that they continue to incur during the holding over period, the prescribed rates generally require tenants to pay such charges during the holding over period, if such charges had been provided for under the contract, prior to its expiry.
