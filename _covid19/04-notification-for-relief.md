### Notification for Relief ### 

We recommend that both parties first discuss, understand each other’s positions, and try to reach a compromise which parties can do, taking into account the framework set out in the Act.

If you require relief under the Act for a contract that is covered by Part 2 of the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){:target="_blank"}, you have to serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b>.

The party seeking relief must serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b> on the following, where applicable:
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligation in the contract; and
* The issuer of a performance bond or equivalent for the performance of the obligation, where the contract is a construction contract or supply contract (“<b>Issuer of Related Performance Bond</b>”).

To serve the <b>Notification for Relief</b> using the electronic system (if you have the email addresses of the above parties):
* For parties who are <u>individuals</u>, please use this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass){:target="_blank"}.
* For parties which are <u>business entities</u>, please use this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass){:target="_blank"}.

To register for a SingPass or CorpPass, please visit [https://www.singpass.gov.sg](https://www.singpass.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} or [https://www.corppass.gov.sg](https://www.corppass.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}, respectively. 

Other modes of service of the Notification for Relief are set out in the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts) Regulations 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S303-2020?DocDate=20200420){:target="_blank"}. If you would like to use these other modes of service, please serve the Notification for Relief using this [form](/files/Form-1.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

**Please note that that the service of the Notification for Relief does not constitute a filing with the Registrar.**

If you have served a Notification of Relief, and there are pending court or arbitral proceedings in respect of the obligations covered under the Notification of Relief against you, please refer to [here](/covid19-relief/memorandum-of-notification) for the processes for you to obtain a stay or dismissal of those proceedings.
