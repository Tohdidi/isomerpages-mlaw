### Notification for Relief ### 

We recommend that both parties first discuss, understand each other’s positions, and try to reach a compromise.

If you require relief under the Act for a contract that is covered by Part 2 of the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){target="blank"}, you have to serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b>.

Step 1 | The party seeking relief must serve a Notification for Relief on the following, where applicable:
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligation in the contract; and
* The issuer of a performance bond or equivalent for the performance of the obligation, where the contract is a construction contract or supply contract (“Issuer of Related Performance Bond”).

To serve the Notification for Relief:
* For parties who are <u>individuals</u>, please use this link (SingPass).
* For parties which are <u>business entities</u>, please use this link (CorpPass).

To register for a SingPass or CorpPass, please visit https://www.singpass.gov.sg or https://www.corppass.gov.sg, respectively.
