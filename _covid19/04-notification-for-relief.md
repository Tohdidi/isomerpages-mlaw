### Notification for Relief ### 

We recommend that both parties first discuss, understand each other’s positions, and try to reach a compromise.

If you require relief under the Act for a contract that is covered by Part 2 of the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020){target="blank"}, you have to serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b>.

Step 1 | The party seeking relief must serve a Notification for Relief on the following, where applicable:
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligation in the contract; and
* The issuer of a performance bond or equivalent for the performance of the obligation, where the contract is a construction contract or supply contract (“Issuer of Related Performance Bond”).
