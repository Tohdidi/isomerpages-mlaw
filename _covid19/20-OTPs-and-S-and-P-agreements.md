### Options to purchase and sale and purchase agreements with housing developers ###

#### General FAQs ####

**a. Does the Act cover Options to Purchase or Sale and Purchase Agreements for industrial / commercial properties?**

* The Act only covers Options to Purchase (“OTPs”), Sale and Purchase Agreements (“S&P Agreements”) and Agreements for Lease (“AFLs”) for residential properties sold by housing developers (including both private housing developers and the Housing & Development Board). It does not cover OTPs and S&P Agreements for non-residential properties such as industrial or commercial properties.


**b.	Does the Act apply to non-residential property leases or licences?**

* The reliefs discussed in this section do not apply to non-residential property leases or licences. Please refer to this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/faq/lease-licence) for the reliefs applicable to leases and licenses of <u>non-residential property</u>.  


**c.	What reliefs under the Act are available to me, the buyer of a residential property?**

**For OTPs**

* If you are unable to exercise the OTP before it expires or are unable to make any payment that is required upon exercising the OTP due to COVID-19, and you have served a Notification for Relief on the developer, the developer may not withhold or forfeit any part of the booking fee (or other consideration paid for the OTP) that you may have paid to the developer. 

**For S&P Agreements / AFLs**

* If you are unable to make a payment due under the S&P Agreement / AFL because of COVID-19, the developer cannot terminate the S&P Agreement or AFL before 19 October 2020.  

* Unless the S&P Agreement / AFL allows for it, the developer is not permitted to increase any charges or interest rates payable, or impose new charges, without your further agreement. Please see (o) below for more details.


**d.	What conditions must I, the buyer, meet to enjoy the reliefs?**

*	All the conditions below must be met: 

**For OTPs**

  *	The OTP was granted by the developer before 25 March 2020 
  
  *	The buyer is unable to <u>make any payment required to</u> exercise the OTP due to COVID-19 
  
  *	The OTP expires on or after 1 February 2020 
  
  *	The booking fee has not been forfeited
  
  *	The buyer has served a Notification for Relief on the developer 

**For S&P Agreements / AFLs**

  *	The S&P Agreement / AFL with the developer was entered into before 25 March 2020 and was still in force as at 13 May 2020
  
  *	The buyer is unable to make a payment due under the S&P Agreement / AFL because of COVID-19 
  
  *	The payment is due on or after 1 February 2020 
  
  *	The buyer has served a Notification for Relief on the developer


**e.	What must I, the buyer, do to enjoy the reliefs?** 

*	The reliefs under the Act do not take effect automatically.

*	If you qualify for the relief, you need to first serve a Notification for Relief on the developer, using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass) or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass).

*	Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the developer, it cannot take the above actions in (c).

**<u>For buyers</u>**


**f.	I cannot make the payment due under the OTP / S&P Agreement / AFL because I have lost my job. Do I qualify for the relief?** 

*	For the relief to apply, your inability to exercise the OTP or make the payment due under the S&P Agreement / AFL must be because of COVID-19. 


**g.	I purchased the residential property together with my partner. We now cannot meet the payment schedule as one of us has lost our job. Do we qualify for the relief?**

*	If you purchased the residential property together with another person, both your circumstances will need to be considered together to determine whether the reliefs apply. 


**h.	Does the Act cover OTPs / S&P Agreements / AFLs for resale HDB flats or private properties?**

*	The Act does **not** cover OTPs / S&P Agreements / AFLs between a buyer and a seller who is not a housing developer. 


**i.	Does the relief extend the Option Period of my OTP?**

*	The relief does not in itself extend the validity of the OTP. 

*	Buyers (of both public and private housing) are encouraged to write to the developer to seek an extension of the OTP, if they need it. Specifically for buyers of private properties, they must also write to the Controller of Housing (if the developer is a licensed housing developer). 

*	This can be done at the same time when a Notification for Relief is served, where possible. 

*	If parties cannot agree on the terms of an extension, they may apply for determination. 

*	The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. 

*	This includes making determinations on the amount of booking fee to be refunded and the validity of the OTP, subject to other regulatory approvals. 


**j.	My OTP expired before13 May 2020 / My developer terminated my S&P Agreement / AFL before 13 May 2020. Does the Act apply?**

*	If your OTP has expired but the booking fee (or part thereof) has not been forfeited, you may serve a Notification for Relief.

*	The Act does not apply to S&P Agreements / AFLs that have been terminated. 

**For OTPs**

*	The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Temporary Relief for Inability to perform Contracts) (Amendment) Regulations implementing these reliefs commenced on 13 May 2020. It does not apply to OTPs in which the booking fee (or any part thereof) has been forfeited.

**k.	My OTP is about to expire, and I still want to exercise it but cannot make the payment due because of COVID-19. I want to seek relief under the Act. What should I do?**

*	If the developer is a licensed housing developer (private housing developer or the Housing & Development Board): 

  *	First, you should serve the developer with a Notification for Relief, as explained further at (e).
  
  *	Once you have served a Notification for Relief, the developer will not be able to forfeit any part of your booking fee during the prescribed period, without an Assessor’s determination. 
  
  *	Next, specifically for <u>private property buyers</u>, you may apply to the Controller of Housing via email at [ura_coh_registry@ura.gov.sg](ura_coh_registry@ura.gov.sg) to extend the OTP. For Executive Condominiums, you may approach the developer directly to extend the OTP. For HDB flat buyers, you may apply to HDB via email at [HDBSales@mailbox.hdb.gov.sg](HDBSales@mailbox.hdb.gov.sg).
  
  *	If the Controller of Housing approves your application to extend the OTP, you should ask the developer for an extension of your OTP. Your OTP will only be extended if the developer agrees. 
  
  *	If the developer does not agree with the extension, you, or the developer, may make an application to the Assessors. 
  
  *	The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, the Assessor may make a determination on how long the OTP should be extended, and the terms of such extension. The Assessor may also make a determination on whether the booking fee (or part thereof) should be refunded. 
  
  *	Please note that any extension of the OTP will be subject to the Controller of Housing’s approval (or the developer’s agreement for Executive Condominiums) or HDB’s approval for HDB flats. 
  
  *	Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.

*	If the developer is not a licensed housing developer: 

  *	First, you should serve the developer with a Notification for Relief, as explained further at (e). 
  
  *	Once you have served a Notification for Relief, the developer will not be able to forfeit any part of your booking fee during the prescribed period, without an Assessor’s determination. 
  
  *	Next, you should discuss with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable solution. If you cannot reach an agreement with the developer, either party may make an application to the Assessors. 
  
  *	The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, the Assessor may make a determination on how long the OTP should be extended, and the terms of such extension. The Assessor may also make a determination on whether the booking fee (or part thereof) should be refunded.

**l.	My OTP is about to expire, and I cannot make the payment due because of COVID-19. I no longer want to exercise the OTP. I want to seek relief under the Act. What should I do?** 

*	First, you should serve the developer with a Notification for Relief, as explained further at (e). 

*	Once you have served a Notification for Relief, the developer will not be able to forfeit any part of your booking fee during the prescribed period, without an Assessor’s determination. 

*	Next, you should discuss with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable solution. If you cannot reach an agreement with the developer, either party may make an application to the Assessors. 

*	The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, the Assessor may make a determination on whether the booking fee (or part thereof) should be refunded.

**m.	I am unable to meet the payment schedule due under the S&P Agreement / AFL because of COVID-19. Should I issue a Notification for Relief or apply for an Assessor’s determination?**

*	If you have been affected by COVID-19, and are unable to make the payments due under your S&P Agreement / AFL, we would encourage you to work together with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. Such mutually acceptable solutions can include partial payments.

*	If you cannot reach an agreement and would like to prevent the developer from terminating the S&P Agreement / AFL, you may serve a Notification for Relief on the developer, who is then prohibited from terminating the S&P Agreement / AFL. This will give you temporary protection up to 19 October 2020.

*	For the avoidance of doubt, your payment obligations continue to accrue in the interim. You are therefore encouraged to use the temporary relief period to work out a solution.

*	In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to meet your payment obligations, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.


**n.	Do I have to pay the accrued missed payments once the prescribed period is over?**

*	Yes. Your payment obligations continue to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. 

*	The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, but seeks to temporarily prohibit the developer from terminating the S&P Agreement / AFL during the relief period.

*	This gives you some breathing space to sort out your finances, and time for you and the developer to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable solution. 


**o.	Can a developer charge me interest or other charges for late payment during the relief period, after I have served the Notification for Relief?**

*	The Act does not remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations. If the agreement provides that the developer can charge interest or charges (be it for late payment or otherwise) in relation to a S&P Agreement / AFL, those charges would accrue and can be enforced by the developer after the relief period.  

*	However, under the Act read with the Regulations, after the buyer serves the Notification for Relief, the developer is **<u>not</u> permitted** to: 

  *	Increase any charges or interest rate payable under the S&P Agreement / AFL without the consent of the buyer unless such increase is (i) specified in the contract or (ii) calculated by reference to a formula (e.g. a reference rate) in the contract 
  
  *	Impose new charges
  
*	The table below illustrates when an increase in interest rate or charges, or an imposition of charges or interest, is or is not permitted. 

|  **Example**  |  **Permitted**  |  **Not Permitted** |
|--|--|--| 
|Contract provides that the developer may charge “_an additional x% p.a. or such other rate as it may in its discretion prescribe_” on overdue payments.|Developer can charge the additional x% p.a.| Developer cannot increase the rate above the additional x% unless the buyer further agrees to the increased rate.|
|Contract provides that the buyer shall “_pay interest at SIBOR plus x% p.a., or such other rate as may be determined” by the developer_ in the event of default.|Developer can charge the stipulated additional interest at SIBOR plus x% p.a.|Developer cannot increase the rate beyond SIBOR plus x% p.a., unless the buyer further agrees to the increased rate.| 
|Contract provides that the developer may charge “$_30 a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full, or any such other charge at its discretion_”.|Developer can charge $30 a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full.  |Developer cannot rely on this clause to increase the charges to more than $30 a day, unless the buyer further agrees to the increased charges.|
|Contract provides that developer may “_impose any charges at its discretion_”.|Developer can impose charges where it relates to expenses that are reasonably incurred by the developer in the ordinary course of business, e.g. administrative charges (including increase) which are based on the developer’s internal schedule of charges and are collected from other buyers with similar S&P Agreements.|Developer cannot rely on this clause to impose a  charge that is not reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, unless the buyer’s further consent is obtained.|
|Contract provides that the developer “reserves the right to vary the conditions in the agreement without the buyer’s consent”.|-|Developer cannot rely on this clause to increase or introduce any new interest or charges, unless the buyer’s further consent is obtained.|


**p.	What can I do if the developer threatens to terminate my S&P Agreement / AFL after I have served the Notification for Relief?**  

*	If a Notification for Relief has been served, it will be an offence under the Act for the developer to terminate your S&P Agreement / AFL.

*	If your developer attempts to take an unlawful action, you may seek an injunction from the court prohibiting the termination. In this regard, you should seek legal advice on whether an injunction is available to you.

*	If there is a disagreement over the Notification for Relief, either party may also make an application to the Assessors for a determination on the case. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and relevant forms. 


**q.	I wish to terminate my S&P Agreement / AFL. Can I get a refund for the payments made before termination?**

*	The Act does not require the developer to refund the payments made (if any) under the S&P Agreement / AFL before termination. Whether you can get a refund for such payments will depend on the terms of the S&P Agreement / AFL. 


**<u>For developers</u>**


r.	I disagree that the buyer is unable to meet his/her payment obligations under the S&P Agreement / AFL. Can I terminate the S&P Agreement / AFL? 

*	If a Notification for Relief has been served, it will be an offence under the Act for you to terminate the S&P Agreement / AFL.

*	If there is a disagreement over the Notification for Relief, either party may make an application to the Assessors for a determination on the case.

**s.	An intending buyer’s OTP is about to expire, and he/she has served me with a Notification for Relief. What should I do?**

  *	Once the intending buyer has served you a Notification for Relief, you may not forfeit or withhold any part of the booking fee during the prescribed period.

  *	If the Controller of Housing (or HDB, for Executive Condominiums) has approved an extension, but you do not agree to the extension – 

    *	You may make an application to the Assessors, who will seek to decide on a just and equitable way to deal with the booking fee. 
    
    * The Assessor may also make a determination on how long you need to extend the OTP for before you may forfeit any part of the booking fee that the intending buyer may have paid to you. Any extension of the OTP will not be inconsistent with the approval of the Controller of Housing (or HDB, for Executive Condominiums).
