There have been scam calls impersonating as MinLaw officers. For more info, please refer [here](https://www.facebook.com/425106448078044/posts/617015012220519/?d=n).<br>

From 2 Jun 2020, the Ministry of Law Services Centre will operate from Mondays to Fridays, 8.30 -5pm (Last ticket will be issued at 4.30pm).<br>

In line with the current safe distancing measures, we will limit the number of visitors to our Services Centre, even as all our services remain accessible to the public, with digital and call services as the primary modes of working. As we will be working on reduced staff strength, longer waiting time is expected at the Services Centre. Members of the public are therefore encouraged to use our [e-services](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/e-services) to reach us or call 1800-2255 529. <br>

If you and/or accompanying persons are unwell with flu-like symptoms, please refrain from visiting the Ministry of Law Services Centre. <br>

For a list of legal support resources available during this period, click [here](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/announcements/Legal-Support-Resources-Available-During-the-Circuit-Breaker).<br>If you are a law practice, please refer to this [advisory](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/announcements/advisory-for-law-practices-on-elevated-safe-distancing-measures) to see how these measures affect you.

There will be scheduled down time on e-Services portals on 25 Sep 2020, from 6pm to 9pm. During this maintenance window, the e-Services portals will be inaccessible. We appreciate your patience and understanding. Thank you.
